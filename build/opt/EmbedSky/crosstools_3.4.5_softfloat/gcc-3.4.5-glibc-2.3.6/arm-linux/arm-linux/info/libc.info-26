File Times
----------

   Each file has three time stamps associated with it:  its access time,
its modification time, and its attribute modification time.  These
correspond to the `st_atime', `st_mtime', and `st_ctime' members of the
`stat' structure; see *Note File Attributes::.

   All of these times are represented in calendar time format, as
`time_t' objects.  This data type is defined in `time.h'.  For more
information about representation and manipulation of time values, see
*Note Calendar Time::.

   Reading from a file updates its access time attribute, and writing
updates its modification time.  When a file is created, all three time
stamps for that file are set to the current time.  In addition, the
attribute change time and modification time fields of the directory that
contains the new entry are updated.

   Adding a new name for a file with the `link' function updates the
attribute change time field of the file being linked, and both the
attribute change time and modification time fields of the directory
containing the new name.  These same fields are affected if a file name
is deleted with `unlink', `remove' or `rmdir'.  Renaming a file with
`rename' affects only the attribute change time and modification time
fields of the two parent directories involved, and not the times for
the file being renamed.

   Changing the attributes of a file (for example, with `chmod')
updates its attribute change time field.

   You can also change some of the time stamps of a file explicitly
using the `utime' function--all except the attribute change time.  You
need to include the header file `utime.h' to use this facility.

 - Data Type: struct utimbuf
     The `utimbuf' structure is used with the `utime' function to
     specify new access and modification times for a file.  It contains
     the following members:

    `time_t actime'
          This is the access time for the file.

    `time_t modtime'
          This is the modification time for the file.

 - Function: int utime (const char *FILENAME, const struct utimbuf
          *TIMES)
     This function is used to modify the file times associated with the
     file named FILENAME.

     If TIMES is a null pointer, then the access and modification times
     of the file are set to the current time.  Otherwise, they are set
     to the values from the `actime' and `modtime' members
     (respectively) of the `utimbuf' structure pointed to by TIMES.

     The attribute modification time for the file is set to the current
     time in either case (since changing the time stamps is itself a
     modification of the file attributes).

     The `utime' function returns `0' if successful and `-1' on
     failure.  In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File
     Name Errors::), the following `errno' error conditions are defined
     for this function:

    `EACCES'
          There is a permission problem in the case where a null
          pointer was passed as the TIMES argument.  In order to update
          the time stamp on the file, you must either be the owner of
          the file, have write permission for the file, or be a
          privileged user.

    `ENOENT'
          The file doesn't exist.

    `EPERM'
          If the TIMES argument is not a null pointer, you must either
          be the owner of the file or be a privileged user.

    `EROFS'
          The file lives on a read-only file system.

   Each of the three time stamps has a corresponding microsecond part,
which extends its resolution.  These fields are called `st_atime_usec',
`st_mtime_usec', and `st_ctime_usec'; each has a value between 0 and
999,999, which indicates the time in microseconds.  They correspond to
the `tv_usec' field of a `timeval' structure; see *Note High-Resolution
Calendar::.

   The `utimes' function is like `utime', but also lets you specify the
fractional part of the file times.  The prototype for this function is
in the header file `sys/time.h'.

 - Function: int utimes (const char *FILENAME, struct timeval TVP[2])
     This function sets the file access and modification times of the
     file FILENAME.  The new file access time is specified by `TVP[0]',
     and the new modification time by `TVP[1]'.  Similar to `utime', if
     TVP is a null pointer then the access and modification times of
     the file are set to the current time.  This function comes from
     BSD.

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for the
     `utime' function.

 - Function: int lutimes (const char *FILENAME, struct timeval TVP[2])
     This function is like `utimes', except that it does not follow
     symbolic links.  If FILENAME is the name of a symbolic link,
     `lutimes' sets the file access and modification times of the
     symbolic link special file itself (as seen by `lstat'; *note
     Symbolic Links::) while `utimes' sets the file access and
     modification times of the file the symbolic link refers to.  This
     function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on all platforms
     (if not available, it will fail with `ENOSYS').

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for the
     `utime' function.

 - Function: int futimes (int *FD, struct timeval TVP[2])
     This function is like `utimes', except that it takes an open file
     descriptor as an argument instead of a file name.  *Note Low-Level
     I/O::.  This function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on
     all platforms (if not available, it will fail with `ENOSYS').

     Like `utimes', `futimes' returns `0' on success and `-1' on
     failure.  The following `errno' error conditions are defined for
     `futimes':

    `EACCES'
          There is a permission problem in the case where a null
          pointer was passed as the TIMES argument.  In order to update
          the time stamp on the file, you must either be the owner of
          the file, have write permission for the file, or be a
          privileged user.

    `EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

    `EPERM'
          If the TIMES argument is not a null pointer, you must either
          be the owner of the file or be a privileged user.

    `EROFS'
          The file lives on a read-only file system.

File Size
---------

   Normally file sizes are maintained automatically.  A file begins
with a size of 0 and is automatically extended when data is written past
its end.  It is also possible to empty a file completely by an `open'
or `fopen' call.

   However, sometimes it is necessary to _reduce_ the size of a file.
This can be done with the `truncate' and `ftruncate' functions.  They
were introduced in BSD Unix.  `ftruncate' was later added to POSIX.1.

   Some systems allow you to extend a file (creating holes) with these
functions.  This is useful when using memory-mapped I/O (*note
Memory-mapped I/O::), where files are not automatically extended.
However, it is not portable but must be implemented if `mmap' allows
mapping of files (i.e., `_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES' is defined).

   Using these functions on anything other than a regular file gives
_undefined_ results.  On many systems, such a call will appear to
succeed, without actually accomplishing anything.

 - Function: int truncate (const char *FILENAME, off_t LENGTH)
     The `truncate' function changes the size of FILENAME to LENGTH.
     If LENGTH is shorter than the previous length, data at the end
     will be lost.  The file must be writable by the user to perform
     this operation.

     If LENGTH is longer, holes will be added to the end.  However, some
     systems do not support this feature and will leave the file
     unchanged.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     `truncate' function is in fact `truncate64' and the type `off_t'
     has 64 bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is 0 for success, or -1 for an error.  In
     addition to the usual file name errors, the following errors may
     occur:

    `EACCES'
          The file is a directory or not writable.

    `EINVAL'
          LENGTH is negative.

    `EFBIG'
          The operation would extend the file beyond the limits of the
          operating system.

    `EIO'
          A hardware I/O error occurred.

    `EPERM'
          The file is "append-only" or "immutable".

    `EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.


 - Function: int truncate64 (const char *NAME, off64_t LENGTH)
     This function is similar to the `truncate' function.  The
     difference is that the LENGTH argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
     bits machines, which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
     2^63 bytes.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name `truncate' and so transparently replaces the 32 bits
     interface.

 - Function: int ftruncate (int FD, off_t LENGTH)
     This is like `truncate', but it works on a file descriptor FD for
     an opened file instead of a file name to identify the object.  The
     file must be opened for writing to successfully carry out the
     operation.

     The POSIX standard leaves it implementation defined what happens
     if the specified new LENGTH of the file is bigger than the
     original size.  The `ftruncate' function might simply leave the
     file alone and do nothing or it can increase the size to the
     desired size.  In this later case the extended area should be
     zero-filled.  So using `ftruncate' is no reliable way to increase
     the file size but if it is possible it is probably the fastest
     way.  The function also operates on POSIX shared memory segments
     if these are implemented by the system.

     `ftruncate' is especially useful in combination with `mmap'.
     Since the mapped region must have a fixed size one cannot enlarge
     the file by writing something beyond the last mapped page.
     Instead one has to enlarge the file itself and then remap the file
     with the new size.  The example below shows how this works.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     `ftruncate' function is in fact `ftruncate64' and the type `off_t'
     has 64 bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is 0 for success, or -1 for an error.  The
     following errors may occur:

    `EBADF'
          FD does not correspond to an open file.

    `EACCES'
          FD is a directory or not open for writing.

    `EINVAL'
          LENGTH is negative.

    `EFBIG'
          The operation would extend the file beyond the limits of the
          operating system.

    `EIO'
          A hardware I/O error occurred.

    `EPERM'
          The file is "append-only" or "immutable".

    `EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.


 - Function: int ftruncate64 (int ID, off64_t LENGTH)
     This function is similar to the `ftruncate' function.  The
     difference is that the LENGTH argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
     bits machines which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
     2^63 bytes.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name `ftruncate' and so transparently replaces the 32 bits
     interface.

   As announced here is a little example of how to use `ftruncate' in
combination with `mmap':

     int fd;
     void *start;
     size_t len;
     
     int
     add (off_t at, void *block, size_t size)
     {
       if (at + size > len)
         {
           /* Resize the file and remap.  */
           size_t ps = sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);
           size_t ns = (at + size + ps - 1) & ~(ps - 1);
           void *np;
           if (ftruncate (fd, ns) < 0)
             return -1;
           np = mmap (NULL, ns, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
           if (np == MAP_FAILED)
             return -1;
           start = np;
           len = ns;
         }
       memcpy ((char *) start + at, block, size);
       return 0;
     }

   The function `add' writes a block of memory at an arbitrary position
in the file.  If the current size of the file is too small it is
extended.  Note the it is extended by a round number of pages.  This is
a requirement of `mmap'.  The program has to keep track of the real
size, and when it has finished a final `ftruncate' call should set the
real size of the file.

Making Special Files
====================

   The `mknod' function is the primitive for making special files, such
as files that correspond to devices.  The GNU library includes this
function for compatibility with BSD.

   The prototype for `mknod' is declared in `sys/stat.h'.

 - Function: int mknod (const char *FILENAME, int MODE, int DEV)
     The `mknod' function makes a special file with name FILENAME.  The
     MODE specifies the mode of the file, and may include the various
     special file bits, such as `S_IFCHR' (for a character special file)
     or `S_IFBLK' (for a block special file).  *Note Testing File
     Type::.

     The DEV argument specifies which device the special file refers to.
     Its exact interpretation depends on the kind of special file being
     created.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on error.  In addition
     to the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          The calling process is not privileged.  Only the superuser
          can create special files.

    `ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system that would contain the new file
          is full and cannot be extended.

    `EROFS'
          The directory containing the new file can't be modified
          because it's on a read-only file system.

    `EEXIST'
          There is already a file named FILENAME.  If you want to
          replace this file, you must remove the old file explicitly
          first.


File: libc.info,  Node: Temporary Files,  Prev: Making Special Files,  Up: File System Interface

Temporary Files
===============

   If you need to use a temporary file in your program, you can use the
`tmpfile' function to open it.  Or you can use the `tmpnam' (better:
`tmpnam_r') function to provide a name for a temporary file and then
you can open it in the usual way with `fopen'.

   The `tempnam' function is like `tmpnam' but lets you choose what
directory temporary files will go in, and something about what their
file names will look like.  Important for multi-threaded programs is
that `tempnam' is reentrant, while `tmpnam' is not since it returns a
pointer to a static buffer.

   These facilities are declared in the header file `stdio.h'.

 - Function: FILE * tmpfile (void)
     This function creates a temporary binary file for update mode, as
     if by calling `fopen' with mode `"wb+"'.  The file is deleted
     automatically when it is closed or when the program terminates.
     (On some other ISO C systems the file may fail to be deleted if
     the program terminates abnormally).

     This function is reentrant.

     When the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact `tmpfile64', i.e. the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: FILE * tmpfile64 (void)
     This function is similar to `tmpfile', but the stream it returns a
     pointer to was opened using `tmpfile64'.  Therefore this stream can
     be used for files larger then 2^31 bytes on 32-bit machines.

     Please note that the return type is still `FILE *'.  There is no
     special `FILE' type for the LFS interface.

     If the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name `tmpfile'
     and so transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: char * tmpnam (char *RESULT)
     This function constructs and returns a valid file name that does
     not refer to any existing file.  If the RESULT argument is a null
     pointer, the return value is a pointer to an internal static
     string, which might be modified by subsequent calls and therefore
     makes this function non-reentrant.  Otherwise, the RESULT argument
     should be a pointer to an array of at least `L_tmpnam' characters,
     and the result is written into that array.

     It is possible for `tmpnam' to fail if you call it too many times
     without removing previously-created files.  This is because the
     limited length of the temporary file names gives room for only a
     finite number of different names.  If `tmpnam' fails it returns a
     null pointer.

     *Warning:* Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using `tmpnam', leading to a possible security hole.  The
     implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted, but
     when opening the file you should use the `O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     `tmpfile' or `mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 - Function: char * tmpnam_r (char *RESULT)
     This function is nearly identical to the `tmpnam' function, except
     that if RESULT is a null pointer it returns a null pointer.

     This guarantees reentrancy because the non-reentrant situation of
     `tmpnam' cannot happen here.

     *Warning*: This function has the same security problems as
     `tmpnam'.

 - Macro: int L_tmpnam
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
     represents the minimum size of a string large enough to hold a
     file name generated by the `tmpnam' function.

 - Macro: int TMP_MAX
     The macro `TMP_MAX' is a lower bound for how many temporary names
     you can create with `tmpnam'.  You can rely on being able to call
     `tmpnam' at least this many times before it might fail saying you
     have made too many temporary file names.

     With the GNU library, you can create a very large number of
     temporary file names.  If you actually created the files, you
     would probably run out of disk space before you ran out of names.
     Some other systems have a fixed, small limit on the number of
     temporary files.  The limit is never less than `25'.

 - Function: char * tempnam (const char *DIR, const char *PREFIX)
     This function generates a unique temporary file name.  If PREFIX
     is not a null pointer, up to five characters of this string are
     used as a prefix for the file name.  The return value is a string
     newly allocated with `malloc', so you should release its storage
     with `free' when it is no longer needed.

     Because the string is dynamically allocated this function is
     reentrant.

     The directory prefix for the temporary file name is determined by
     testing each of the following in sequence.  The directory must
     exist and be writable.

        * The environment variable `TMPDIR', if it is defined.  For
          security reasons this only happens if the program is not SUID
          or SGID enabled.

        * The DIR argument, if it is not a null pointer.

        * The value of the `P_tmpdir' macro.

        * The directory `/tmp'.

     This function is defined for SVID compatibility.

     *Warning:* Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using `tempnam', leading to a possible security hole.
     The implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted,
     but when opening the file you should use the `O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     `tmpfile' or `mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 - SVID Macro: char * P_tmpdir
     This macro is the name of the default directory for temporary
     files.

   Older Unix systems did not have the functions just described.
Instead they used `mktemp' and `mkstemp'.  Both of these functions work
by modifying a file name template string you pass.  The last six
characters of this string must be `XXXXXX'.  These six `X's are
replaced with six characters which make the whole string a unique file
name.  Usually the template string is something like
`/tmp/PREFIXXXXXXX', and each program uses a unique PREFIX.

   *Note:* Because `mktemp' and `mkstemp' modify the template string,
you _must not_ pass string constants to them.  String constants are
normally in read-only storage, so your program would crash when
`mktemp' or `mkstemp' tried to modify the string.  These functions are
declared in the header file `stdlib.h'.

 - Function: char * mktemp (char *TEMPLATE)
     The `mktemp' function generates a unique file name by modifying
     TEMPLATE as described above.  If successful, it returns TEMPLATE
     as modified.  If `mktemp' cannot find a unique file name, it makes
     TEMPLATE an empty string and returns that.  If TEMPLATE does not
     end with `XXXXXX', `mktemp' returns a null pointer.

     *Warning:* Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using `mktemp', leading to a possible security hole.  The
     implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted, but
     when opening the file you should use the `O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     `mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 - Function: int mkstemp (char *TEMPLATE)
     The `mkstemp' function generates a unique file name just as
     `mktemp' does, but it also opens the file for you with `open'
     (*note Opening and Closing Files::).  If successful, it modifies
     TEMPLATE in place and returns a file descriptor for that file open
     for reading and writing.  If `mkstemp' cannot create a
     uniquely-named file, it returns `-1'.  If TEMPLATE does not end
     with `XXXXXX', `mkstemp' returns `-1' and does not modify TEMPLATE.

     The file is opened using mode `0600'.  If the file is meant to be
     used by other users this mode must be changed explicitly.

   Unlike `mktemp', `mkstemp' is actually guaranteed to create a unique
file that cannot possibly clash with any other program trying to create
a temporary file.  This is because it works by calling `open' with the
`O_EXCL' flag, which says you want to create a new file and get an
error if the file already exists.

 - Function: char * mkdtemp (char *TEMPLATE)
     The `mkdtemp' function creates a directory with a unique name.  If
     it succeeds, it overwrites TEMPLATE with the name of the
     directory, and returns TEMPLATE.  As with `mktemp' and `mkstemp',
     TEMPLATE should be a string ending with `XXXXXX'.

     If `mkdtemp' cannot create an uniquely named directory, it returns
     `NULL' and sets ERRNO appropriately.  If TEMPLATE does not end
     with `XXXXXX', `mkdtemp' returns `NULL' and does not modify
     TEMPLATE.  ERRNO will be set to `EINVAL' in this case.

     The directory is created using mode `0700'.

   The directory created by `mkdtemp' cannot clash with temporary files
or directories created by other users.  This is because directory
creation always works like `open' with `O_EXCL'.  *Note Creating
Directories::.

   The `mkdtemp' function comes from OpenBSD.

Pipes and FIFOs
***************

   A "pipe" is a mechanism for interprocess communication; data written
to the pipe by one process can be read by another process.  The data is
handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.  The pipe has no name; it
is created for one use and both ends must be inherited from the single
process which created the pipe.

   A "FIFO special file" is similar to a pipe, but instead of being an
anonymous, temporary connection, a FIFO has a name or names like any
other file.  Processes open the FIFO by name in order to communicate
through it.

   A pipe or FIFO has to be open at both ends simultaneously.  If you
read from a pipe or FIFO file that doesn't have any processes writing
to it (perhaps because they have all closed the file, or exited), the
read returns end-of-file.  Writing to a pipe or FIFO that doesn't have a
reading process is treated as an error condition; it generates a
`SIGPIPE' signal, and fails with error code `EPIPE' if the signal is
handled or blocked.

   Neither pipes nor FIFO special files allow file positioning.  Both
reading and writing operations happen sequentially; reading from the
beginning of the file and writing at the end.

Creating a Pipe
===============

   The primitive for creating a pipe is the `pipe' function.  This
creates both the reading and writing ends of the pipe.  It is not very
useful for a single process to use a pipe to talk to itself.  In typical
use, a process creates a pipe just before it forks one or more child
processes (*note Creating a Process::).  The pipe is then used for
communication either between the parent or child processes, or between
two sibling processes.

   The `pipe' function is declared in the header file `unistd.h'.

 - Function: int pipe (int FILEDES[2])
     The `pipe' function creates a pipe and puts the file descriptors
     for the reading and writing ends of the pipe (respectively) into
     `FILEDES[0]' and `FILEDES[1]'.

     An easy way to remember that the input end comes first is that file
     descriptor `0' is standard input, and file descriptor `1' is
     standard output.

     If successful, `pipe' returns a value of `0'.  On failure, `-1' is
     returned.  The following `errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

    `EMFILE'
          The process has too many files open.

    `ENFILE'
          There are too many open files in the entire system.  *Note
          Error Codes::, for more information about `ENFILE'.  This
          error never occurs in the GNU system.

   Here is an example of a simple program that creates a pipe.  This
program uses the `fork' function (*note Creating a Process::) to create
a child process.  The parent process writes data to the pipe, which is
read by the child process.

     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     
     /* Read characters from the pipe and echo them to `stdout'. */

     read_from_pipe (int file)
     {
       FILE *stream;
       int c;
       stream = fdopen (file, "r");
       while ((c = fgetc (stream)) != EOF)
         putchar (c);
       fclose (stream);
     }

Pipe to a Subprocess
====================

   A common use of pipes is to send data to or receive data from a
program being run as a subprocess.  One way of doing this is by using a
combination of `pipe' (to create the pipe), `fork' (to create the
subprocess), `dup2' (to force the subprocess to use the pipe as its
standard input or output channel), and `exec' (to execute the new
program).  Or, you can use `popen' and `pclose'.

   The advantage of using `popen' and `pclose' is that the interface is
much simpler and easier to use.  But it doesn't offer as much
flexibility as using the low-level functions directly.

 - Function: FILE * popen (const char *COMMAND, const char *MODE)
     The `popen' function is closely related to the `system' function;
     see *Note Running a Command::.  It executes the shell command
     COMMAND as a subprocess.  However, instead of waiting for the
     command to complete, it creates a pipe to the subprocess and
     returns a stream that corresponds to that pipe.

     If you specify a MODE argument of `"r"', you can read from the
     stream to retrieve data from the standard output channel of the
     subprocess.  The subprocess inherits its standard input channel
     from the parent process.

     Similarly, if you specify a MODE argument of `"w"', you can write
     to the stream to send data to the standard input channel of the
     subprocess.  The subprocess inherits its standard output channel
     from the parent process.

     In the event of an error `popen' returns a null pointer.  This
     might happen if the pipe or stream cannot be created, if the
     subprocess cannot be forked, or if the program cannot be executed.

 - Function: int pclose (FILE *STREAM)
     The `pclose' function is used to close a stream created by `popen'.
     It waits for the child process to terminate and returns its status
     value, as for the `system' function.

   Here is an example showing how to use `popen' and `pclose' to filter
output through another program, in this case the paging program `more'.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     
     void
     write_data (FILE * stream)
     {
       int i;
       for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
         fprintf (stream, "%d\n", i);
       if (ferror (stream))
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Output to stream failed.\n");
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }
     }
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       FILE *output;
     
       output = popen ("more", "w");
       if (!output)
         {
           fprintf (stderr,
                    "incorrect parameters or too many files.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }
       write_data (output);
       if (pclose (output) != 0)
         {
           fprintf (stderr,
                    "Could not run more or other error.\n");
         }
       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

FIFO Special Files
==================

   A FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it is created
in a different way.  Instead of being an anonymous communications
channel, a FIFO special file is entered into the file system by calling
`mkfifo'.

   Once you have created a FIFO special file in this way, any process
can open it for reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file.
However, it has to be open at both ends simultaneously before you can
proceed to do any input or output operations on it.  Opening a FIFO for
reading normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO for
writing, and vice versa.

   The `mkfifo' function is declared in the header file `sys/stat.h'.

 - Function: int mkfifo (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)
     The `mkfifo' function makes a FIFO special file with name
     FILENAME.  The MODE argument is used to set the file's
     permissions; see *Note Setting Permissions::.

     The normal, successful return value from `mkfifo' is `0'.  In the
     case of an error, `-1' is returned.  In addition to the usual file
     name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following `errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EEXIST'
          The named file already exists.

    `ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system cannot be extended.

    `EROFS'
          The directory that would contain the file resides on a
          read-only file system.

Atomicity of Pipe I/O
=====================

   Reading or writing pipe data is "atomic" if the size of data written
is not greater than `PIPE_BUF'.  This means that the data transfer
seems to be an instantaneous unit, in that nothing else in the system
can observe a state in which it is partially complete.  Atomic I/O may
not begin right away (it may need to wait for buffer space or for data),
but once it does begin it finishes immediately.

   Reading or writing a larger amount of data may not be atomic; for
example, output data from other processes sharing the descriptor may be
interspersed.  Also, once `PIPE_BUF' characters have been written,
further writes will block until some characters are read.

   *Note Limits for Files::, for information about the `PIPE_BUF'
parameter.

Sockets
*******

   This chapter describes the GNU facilities for interprocess
communication using sockets.

   A "socket" is a generalized interprocess communication channel.
Like a pipe, a socket is represented as a file descriptor.  Unlike pipes
sockets support communication between unrelated processes, and even
between processes running on different machines that communicate over a
network.  Sockets are the primary means of communicating with other
machines; `telnet', `rlogin', `ftp', `talk' and the other familiar
network programs use sockets.

   Not all operating systems support sockets.  In the GNU library, the
header file `sys/socket.h' exists regardless of the operating system,
and the socket functions always exist, but if the system does not
really support sockets these functions always fail.

Socket Concepts
===============

   When you create a socket, you must specify the style of communication
you want to use and the type of protocol that should implement it.  The
"communication style" of a socket defines the user-level semantics of
sending and receiving data on the socket.  Choosing a communication
style specifies the answers to questions such as these:

   * *What are the units of data transmission?*  Some communication
     styles regard the data as a sequence of bytes with no larger
     structure; others group the bytes into records (which are known in
     this context as "packets").

   * *Can data be lost during normal operation?*  Some communication
     styles guarantee that all the data sent arrives in the order it was
     sent (barring system or network crashes); other styles occasionally
     lose data as a normal part of operation, and may sometimes deliver
     packets more than once or in the wrong order.

     Designing a program to use unreliable communication styles usually
     involves taking precautions to detect lost or misordered packets
     and to retransmit data as needed.

   * *Is communication entirely with one partner?*  Some communication
     styles are like a telephone call--you make a "connection" with one
     remote socket and then exchange data freely.  Other styles are
     like mailing letters--you specify a destination address for each
     message you send.

   You must also choose a "namespace" for naming the socket.  A socket
name ("address") is meaningful only in the context of a particular
namespace.  In fact, even the data type to use for a socket name may
depend on the namespace.  Namespaces are also called "domains", but we
avoid that word as it can be confused with other usage of the same
term.  Each namespace has a symbolic name that starts with `PF_'.  A
corresponding symbolic name starting with `AF_' designates the address
format for that namespace.

   Finally you must choose the "protocol" to carry out the
communication.  The protocol determines what low-level mechanism is used
to transmit and receive data.  Each protocol is valid for a particular
namespace and communication style; a namespace is sometimes called a
"protocol family" because of this, which is why the namespace names
start with `PF_'.

   The rules of a protocol apply to the data passing between two
programs, perhaps on different computers; most of these rules are
handled by the operating system and you need not know about them.  What
you do need to know about protocols is this:

   * In order to have communication between two sockets, they must
     specify the _same_ protocol.

   * Each protocol is meaningful with particular style/namespace
     combinations and cannot be used with inappropriate combinations.
     For example, the TCP protocol fits only the byte stream style of
     communication and the Internet namespace.

   * For each combination of style and namespace there is a "default
     protocol", which you can request by specifying 0 as the protocol
     number.  And that's what you should normally do--use the default.

   Throughout the following description at various places
variables/parameters to denote sizes are required.  And here the trouble
starts.  In the first implementations the type of these variables was
simply `int'.  On most machines at that time an `int' was 32 bits wide,
which created a _de facto_ standard requiring 32-bit variables.  This
is important since references to variables of this type are passed to
the kernel.

   Then the POSIX people came and unified the interface with the words
"all size values are of type `size_t'".  On 64-bit machines `size_t' is
64 bits wide, so pointers to variables were no longer possible.

   The Unix98 specification provides a solution by introducing a type
`socklen_t'.  This type is used in all of the cases that POSIX changed
to use `size_t'.  The only requirement of this type is that it be an
unsigned type of at least 32 bits.  Therefore, implementations which
require that references to 32-bit variables be passed can be as happy
as implementations which use 64-bit values.

Communication Styles
====================

   The GNU library includes support for several different kinds of
sockets, each with different characteristics.  This section describes
the supported socket types.  The symbolic constants listed here are
defined in `sys/socket.h'.

 - Macro: int SOCK_STREAM
     The `SOCK_STREAM' style is like a pipe (*note Pipes and FIFOs::).
     It operates over a connection with a particular remote socket and
     transmits data reliably as a stream of bytes.

     Use of this style is covered in detail in *Note Connections::.

 - Macro: int SOCK_DGRAM
     The `SOCK_DGRAM' style is used for sending individually-addressed
     packets unreliably.  It is the diametrical opposite of
     `SOCK_STREAM'.

     Each time you write data to a socket of this kind, that data
     becomes one packet.  Since `SOCK_DGRAM' sockets do not have
     connections, you must specify the recipient address with each
     packet.

     The only guarantee that the system makes about your requests to
     transmit data is that it will try its best to deliver each packet
     you send.  It may succeed with the sixth packet after failing with
     the fourth and fifth packets; the seventh packet may arrive before
     the sixth, and may arrive a second time after the sixth.

     The typical use for `SOCK_DGRAM' is in situations where it is
     acceptable to simply re-send a packet if no response is seen in a
     reasonable amount of time.

     *Note Datagrams::, for detailed information about how to use
     datagram sockets.

 - Macro: int SOCK_RAW
     This style provides access to low-level network protocols and
     interfaces.  Ordinary user programs usually have no need to use
     this style.


File: libc.info,  Node: Socket Addresses,  Next: Interface Naming,  Prev: Communication Styles,  Up: Sockets

Socket Addresses
================

   The name of a socket is normally called an "address".  The functions
and symbols for dealing with socket addresses were named
inconsistently, sometimes using the term "name" and sometimes using
"address".  You can regard these terms as synonymous where sockets are
concerned.

   A socket newly created with the `socket' function has no address.
Other processes can find it for communication only if you give it an
address.  We call this "binding" the address to the socket, and the way
to do it is with the `bind' function.

   You need be concerned with the address of a socket if other processes
are to find it and start communicating with it.  You can specify an
address for other sockets, but this is usually pointless; the first time
you send data from a socket, or use it to initiate a connection, the
system assigns an address automatically if you have not specified one.

   Occasionally a client needs to specify an address because the server
discriminates based on address; for example, the rsh and rlogin
protocols look at the client's socket address and only bypass password
checking if it is less than `IPPORT_RESERVED' (*note Ports::).

   The details of socket addresses vary depending on what namespace you
are using.  *Note Local Namespace::, or *Note Internet Namespace::, for
specific information.

   Regardless of the namespace, you use the same functions `bind' and
`getsockname' to set and examine a socket's address.  These functions
use a phony data type, `struct sockaddr *', to accept the address.  In
practice, the address lives in a structure of some other data type
appropriate to the address format you are using, but you cast its
address to `struct sockaddr *' when you pass it to `bind'.

* Menu:

* Address Formats::		About `struct sockaddr'.
* Setting Address::		Binding an address to a socket.
* Reading Address::		Reading the address of a socket.


File: libc.info,  Node: Address Formats,  Next: Setting Address,  Up: Socket Addresses

Address Formats
---------------

   The functions `bind' and `getsockname' use the generic data type
`struct sockaddr *' to represent a pointer to a socket address.  You
can't use this data type effectively to interpret an address or
construct one; for that, you must use the proper data type for the
socket's namespace.

   Thus, the usual practice is to construct an address of the proper
namespace-specific type, then cast a pointer to `struct sockaddr *'
when you call `bind' or `getsockname'.

   The one piece of information that you can get from the `struct
sockaddr' data type is the "address format designator".  This tells you
which data type to use to understand the address fully.

   The symbols in this section are defined in the header file
`sys/socket.h'.

 - Data Type: struct sockaddr
     The `struct sockaddr' type itself has the following members:

    `short int sa_family'
          This is the code for the address format of this address.  It
          identifies the format of the data which follows.

    `char sa_data[14]'
          This is the actual socket address data, which is
          format-dependent.  Its length also depends on the format, and
          may well be more than 14.  The length 14 of `sa_data' is
          essentially arbitrary.

   Each address format has a symbolic name which starts with `AF_'.
Each of them corresponds to a `PF_' symbol which designates the
corresponding namespace.  Here is a list of address format names:

`AF_LOCAL'
     This designates the address format that goes with the local
     namespace.  (`PF_LOCAL' is the name of that namespace.)  *Note
     Local Namespace Details::, for information about this address
     format.

`AF_UNIX'
     This is a synonym for `AF_LOCAL'.  Although `AF_LOCAL' is mandated
     by POSIX.1g, `AF_UNIX' is portable to more systems.  `AF_UNIX' was
     the traditional name stemming from BSD, so even most POSIX systems
     support it.  It is also the name of choice in the Unix98
     specification. (The same is true for `PF_UNIX' vs. `PF_LOCAL').

`AF_FILE'
     This is another synonym for `AF_LOCAL', for compatibility.
     (`PF_FILE' is likewise a synonym for `PF_LOCAL'.)

`AF_INET'
     This designates the address format that goes with the Internet
     namespace.  (`PF_INET' is the name of that namespace.)  *Note
     Internet Address Formats::.

`AF_INET6'
     This is similar to `AF_INET', but refers to the IPv6 protocol.
     (`PF_INET6' is the name of the corresponding namespace.)

`AF_UNSPEC'
     This designates no particular address format.  It is used only in
     rare cases, such as to clear out the default destination address
     of a "connected" datagram socket.  *Note Sending Datagrams::.

     The corresponding namespace designator symbol `PF_UNSPEC' exists
     for completeness, but there is no reason to use it in a program.

   `sys/socket.h' defines symbols starting with `AF_' for many
different kinds of networks, most or all of which are not actually
implemented.  We will document those that really work as we receive
information about how to use them.


File: libc.info,  Node: Setting Address,  Next: Reading Address,  Prev: Address Formats,  Up: Socket Addresses

Setting the Address of a Socket
-------------------------------

   Use the `bind' function to assign an address to a socket.  The
prototype for `bind' is in the header file `sys/socket.h'.  For
examples of use, see *Note Local Socket Example::, or see *Note Inet
Example::.

 - Function: int bind (int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADDR, socklen_t
          LENGTH)
     The `bind' function assigns an address to the socket SOCKET.  The
     ADDR and LENGTH arguments specify the address; the detailed format
     of the address depends on the namespace.  The first part of the
     address is always the format designator, which specifies a
     namespace, and says that the address is in the format of that
     namespace.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EBADF'
          The SOCKET argument is not a valid file descriptor.

    `ENOTSOCK'
          The descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

    `EADDRNOTAVAIL'
          The specified address is not available on this machine.

    `EADDRINUSE'
          Some other socket is already using the specified address.

    `EINVAL'
          The socket SOCKET already has an address.

    `EACCES'
          You do not have permission to access the requested address.
          (In the Internet domain, only the super-user is allowed to
          specify a port number in the range 0 through
          `IPPORT_RESERVED' minus one; see *Note Ports::.)

     Additional conditions may be possible depending on the particular
     namespace of the socket.
