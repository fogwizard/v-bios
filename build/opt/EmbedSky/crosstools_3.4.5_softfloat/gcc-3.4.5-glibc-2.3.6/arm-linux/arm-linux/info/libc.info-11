File: libc.info,  Node: glibc iconv Implementation,  Prev: Other iconv Implementations,  Up: Generic Charset Conversion

The `iconv' Implementation in the GNU C library
-----------------------------------------------

   After reading about the problems of `iconv' implementations in the
last section it is certainly good to note that the implementation in
the GNU C library has none of the problems mentioned above.  What
follows is a step-by-step analysis of the points raised above.  The
evaluation is based on the current state of the development (as of
January 1999).  The development of the `iconv' functions is not
complete, but basic functionality has solidified.

   The GNU C library's `iconv' implementation uses shared loadable
modules to implement the conversions.  A very small number of
conversions are built into the library itself but these are only rather
trivial conversions.

   All the benefits of loadable modules are available in the GNU C
library implementation.  This is especially appealing since the
interface is well documented (see below), and it, therefore, is easy to
write new conversion modules.  The drawback of using loadable objects
is not a problem in the GNU C library, at least on ELF systems.  Since
the library is able to load shared objects even in statically linked
binaries, static linking need not be forbidden in case one wants to use
`iconv'.

   The second mentioned problem is the number of supported conversions.
Currently, the GNU C library supports more than 150 character sets.  The
way the implementation is designed the number of supported conversions
is greater than 22350 (150 times 149).  If any conversion from or to a
character set is missing, it can be added easily.

   Particularly impressive as it may be, this high number is due to the
fact that the GNU C library implementation of `iconv' does not have the
third problem mentioned above (i.e., whenever there is a conversion
from a character set A to B and from B to C it is always possible to
convert from A to C directly).  If the `iconv_open' returns an error
and sets `errno' to `EINVAL', there is no known way, directly or
indirectly, to perform the wanted conversion.

   Triangulation is achieved by providing for each character set a
conversion from and to UCS-4 encoded ISO 10646.  Using ISO 10646 as an
intermediate representation it is possible to "triangulate" (i.e.,
convert with an intermediate representation).

   There is no inherent requirement to provide a conversion to
ISO 10646 for a new character set, and it is also possible to provide
other conversions where neither source nor destination character set is
ISO 10646.  The existing set of conversions is simply meant to cover all
conversions that might be of interest.

   All currently available conversions use the triangulation method
above, making conversion run unnecessarily slow.  If, for example,
somebody often needs the conversion from ISO-2022-JP to EUC-JP, a
quicker solution would involve direct conversion between the two
character sets, skipping the input to ISO 10646 first.  The two
character sets of interest are much more similar to each other than to
ISO 10646.

   In such a situation one easily can write a new conversion and
provide it as a better alternative.  The GNU C library `iconv'
implementation would automatically use the module implementing the
conversion if it is specified to be more efficient.

Format of `gconv-modules' files
...............................

   All information about the available conversions comes from a file
named `gconv-modules', which can be found in any of the directories
along the `GCONV_PATH'.  The `gconv-modules' files are line-oriented
text files, where each of the lines has one of the following formats:

   * If the first non-whitespace character is a `#' the line contains
     only comments and is ignored.

   * Lines starting with `alias' define an alias name for a character
     set.  Two more words are expected on the line.  The first word
     defines the alias name, and the second defines the original name
     of the character set.  The effect is that it is possible to use
     the alias name in the FROMSET or TOSET parameters of `iconv_open'
     and achieve the same result as when using the real character set
     name.

     This is quite important as a character set has often many different
     names.  There is normally an official name but this need not
     correspond to the most popular name.  Beside this many character
     sets have special names that are somehow constructed.  For
     example, all character sets specified by the ISO have an alias of
     the form `ISO-IR-NNN' where NNN is the registration number.  This
     allows programs that know about the registration number to
     construct character set names and use them in `iconv_open' calls.
     More on the available names and aliases follows below.

   * Lines starting with `module' introduce an available conversion
     module.  These lines must contain three or four more words.

     The first word specifies the source character set, the second word
     the destination character set of conversion implemented in this
     module, and the third word is the name of the loadable module.
     The filename is constructed by appending the usual shared object
     suffix (normally `.so') and this file is then supposed to be found
     in the same directory the `gconv-modules' file is in.  The last
     word on the line, which is optional, is a numeric value
     representing the cost of the conversion.  If this word is missing,
     a cost of 1 is assumed.  The numeric value itself does not matter
     that much; what counts are the relative values of the sums of
     costs for all possible conversion paths.  Below is a more precise
     description of the use of the cost value.

   Returning to the example above where one has written a module to
directly convert from ISO-2022-JP to EUC-JP and back.  All that has to
be done is to put the new module, let its name be ISO2022JP-EUCJP.so,
in a directory and add a file `gconv-modules' with the following
content in the same directory:

     module  ISO-2022-JP//   EUC-JP//        ISO2022JP-EUCJP    1
     module  EUC-JP//        ISO-2022-JP//   ISO2022JP-EUCJP    1

   To see why this is sufficient, it is necessary to understand how the
conversion used by `iconv' (and described in the descriptor) is
selected.  The approach to this problem is quite simple.

   At the first call of the `iconv_open' function the program reads all
available `gconv-modules' files and builds up two tables: one
containing all the known aliases and another that contains the
information about the conversions and which shared object implements
them.

Finding the conversion path in `iconv'
......................................

   The set of available conversions form a directed graph with weighted
edges.  The weights on the edges are the costs specified in the
`gconv-modules' files.  The `iconv_open' function uses an algorithm
suitable for search for the best path in such a graph and so constructs
a list of conversions that must be performed in succession to get the
transformation from the source to the destination character set.

   Explaining why the above `gconv-modules' files allows the `iconv'
implementation to resolve the specific ISO-2022-JP to EUC-JP conversion
module instead of the conversion coming with the library itself is
straightforward.  Since the latter conversion takes two steps (from
ISO-2022-JP to ISO 10646 and then from ISO 10646 to EUC-JP), the cost
is 1+1 = 2.  The above `gconv-modules' file, however, specifies that
the new conversion modules can perform this conversion with only the
cost of 1.

   A mysterious item about the `gconv-modules' file above (and also the
file coming with the GNU C library) are the names of the character sets
specified in the `module' lines.  Why do almost all the names end in
`//'?  And this is not all: the names can actually be regular
expressions.  At this point in time this mystery should not be
revealed, unless you have the relevant spell-casting materials: ashes
from an original DOS 6.2 boot disk burnt in effigy, a crucifix blessed
by St. Emacs, assorted herbal roots from Central America, sand from
Cebu, etc.  Sorry!  *The part of the implementation where this is used
is not yet finished.  For now please simply follow the existing
examples.  It'll become clearer once it is. -drepper*

   A last remark about the `gconv-modules' is about the names not
ending with `//'.  A character set named `INTERNAL' is often mentioned.
From the discussion above and the chosen name it should have become
clear that this is the name for the representation used in the
intermediate step of the triangulation.  We have said that this is UCS-4
but actually that is not quite right.  The UCS-4 specification also
includes the specification of the byte ordering used.  Since a UCS-4
value consists of four bytes, a stored value is effected by byte
ordering.  The internal representation is _not_ the same as UCS-4 in
case the byte ordering of the processor (or at least the running
process) is not the same as the one required for UCS-4.  This is done
for performance reasons as one does not want to perform unnecessary
byte-swapping operations if one is not interested in actually seeing
the result in UCS-4.  To avoid trouble with endianess, the internal
representation consistently is named `INTERNAL' even on big-endian
systems where the representations are identical.

`iconv' module data structures
..............................

   So far this section has described how modules are located and
considered to be used.  What remains to be described is the interface
of the modules so that one can write new ones. This section describes
the interface as it is in use in January 1999.  The interface will
change a bit in the future but, with luck, only in an upwardly
compatible way.

   The definitions necessary to write new modules are publicly available
in the non-standard header `gconv.h'.  The following text, therefore,
describes the definitions from this header file.  First, however, it is
necessary to get an overview.

   From the perspective of the user of `iconv' the interface is quite
simple: the `iconv_open' function returns a handle that can be used in
calls to `iconv', and finally the handle is freed with a call to
`iconv_close'.  The problem is that the handle has to be able to
represent the possibly long sequences of conversion steps and also the
state of each conversion since the handle is all that is passed to the
`iconv' function.  Therefore, the data structures are really the
elements necessary to understanding the implementation.

   We need two different kinds of data structures.  The first describes
the conversion and the second describes the state etc.  There are
really two type definitions like this in `gconv.h'.

 - Data type: struct __gconv_step
     This data structure describes one conversion a module can perform.
     For each function in a loaded module with conversion functions
     there is exactly one object of this type.  This object is shared
     by all users of the conversion (i.e., this object does not contain
     any information corresponding to an actual conversion; it only
     describes the conversion itself).

    `struct __gconv_loaded_object *__shlib_handle'
    `const char *__modname'
    `int __counter'
          All these elements of the structure are used internally in
          the C library to coordinate loading and unloading the shared.
          One must not expect any of the other elements to be
          available or initialized.

    `const char *__from_name'
    `const char *__to_name'
          `__from_name' and `__to_name' contain the names of the source
          and destination character sets.  They can be used to identify
          the actual conversion to be carried out since one module
          might implement conversions for more than one character set
          and/or direction.

    `gconv_fct __fct'
    `gconv_init_fct __init_fct'
    `gconv_end_fct __end_fct'
          These elements contain pointers to the functions in the
          loadable module.  The interface will be explained below.

    `int __min_needed_from'
    `int __max_needed_from'
    `int __min_needed_to'
    `int __max_needed_to;'
          These values have to be supplied in the init function of the
          module.  The `__min_needed_from' value specifies how many
          bytes a character of the source character set at least needs.
          The `__max_needed_from' specifies the maximum value that
          also includes possible shift sequences.

          The `__min_needed_to' and `__max_needed_to' values serve the
          same purpose as `__min_needed_from' and `__max_needed_from'
          but this time for the destination character set.

          It is crucial that these values be accurate since otherwise
          the conversion functions will have problems or not work at
          all.

    `int __stateful'
          This element must also be initialized by the init function.
          `int __stateful' is nonzero if the source character set is
          stateful.  Otherwise it is zero.

    `void *__data'
          This element can be used freely by the conversion functions
          in the module.  `void *__data' can be used to communicate
          extra information from one call to another.  `void *__data'
          need not be initialized if not needed at all.  If `void
          *__data' element is assigned a pointer to dynamically
          allocated memory (presumably in the init function) it has to
          be made sure that the end function deallocates the memory.
          Otherwise the application will leak memory.

          It is important to be aware that this data structure is
          shared by all users of this specification conversion and
          therefore the `__data' element must not contain data specific
          to one specific use of the conversion function.

 - Data type: struct __gconv_step_data
     This is the data structure that contains the information specific
     to each use of the conversion functions.

    `char *__outbuf'
    `char *__outbufend'
          These elements specify the output buffer for the conversion
          step.  The `__outbuf' element points to the beginning of the
          buffer, and `__outbufend' points to the byte following the
          last byte in the buffer.  The conversion function must not
          assume anything about the size of the buffer but it can be
          safely assumed the there is room for at least one complete
          character in the output buffer.

          Once the conversion is finished, if the conversion is the
          last step, the `__outbuf' element must be modified to point
          after the last byte written into the buffer to signal how
          much output is available.  If this conversion step is not the
          last one, the element must not be modified.  The
          `__outbufend' element must not be modified.

    `int __is_last'
          This element is nonzero if this conversion step is the last
          one.  This information is necessary for the recursion.  See
          the description of the conversion function internals below.
          This element must never be modified.

    `int __invocation_counter'
          The conversion function can use this element to see how many
          calls of the conversion function already happened.  Some
          character sets require a certain prolog when generating
          output, and by comparing this value with zero, one can find
          out whether it is the first call and whether, therefore, the
          prolog should be emitted.  This element must never be
          modified.

    `int __internal_use'
          This element is another one rarely used but needed in certain
          situations.  It is assigned a nonzero value in case the
          conversion functions are used to implement `mbsrtowcs' et.al.
          (i.e., the function is not used directly through the `iconv'
          interface).

          This sometimes makes a difference as it is expected that the
          `iconv' functions are used to translate entire texts while the
          `mbsrtowcs' functions are normally used only to convert single
          strings and might be used multiple times to convert entire
          texts.

          But in this situation we would have problem complying with
          some rules of the character set specification.  Some
          character sets require a prolog, which must appear exactly
          once for an entire text.  If a number of `mbsrtowcs' calls
          are used to convert the text, only the first call must add
          the prolog.  However, because there is no communication
          between the different calls of `mbsrtowcs', the conversion
          functions have no possibility to find this out.  The
          situation is different for sequences of `iconv' calls since
          the handle allows access to the needed information.

          The `int __internal_use' element is mostly used together with
          `__invocation_counter' as follows:

               if (!data->__internal_use
                    && data->__invocation_counter == 0)
                 /* Emit prolog.  */
                 ...

          This element must never be modified.

    `mbstate_t *__statep'
          The `__statep' element points to an object of type `mbstate_t'
          (*note Keeping the state::).  The conversion of a stateful
          character set must use the object pointed to by `__statep' to
          store information about the conversion state.  The `__statep'
          element itself must never be modified.

    `mbstate_t __state'
          This element must _never_ be used directly.  It is only part
          of this structure to have the needed space allocated.

`iconv' module interfaces
.........................

   With the knowledge about the data structures we now can describe the
conversion function itself.  To understand the interface a bit of
knowledge is necessary about the functionality in the C library that
loads the objects with the conversions.

   It is often the case that one conversion is used more than once
(i.e., there are several `iconv_open' calls for the same set of
character sets during one program run).  The `mbsrtowcs' et.al.
functions in the GNU C library also use the `iconv' functionality, which
increases the number of uses of the same functions even more.

   Because of this multiple use of conversions, the modules do not get
loaded exclusively for one conversion.  Instead a module once loaded can
be used by an arbitrary number of `iconv' or `mbsrtowcs' calls at the
same time.  The splitting of the information between conversion-
function-specific information and conversion data makes this possible.
The last section showed the two data structures used to do this.

   This is of course also reflected in the interface and semantics of
the functions that the modules must provide.  There are three functions
that must have the following names:

`gconv_init'
     The `gconv_init' function initializes the conversion function
     specific data structure.  This very same object is shared by all
     conversions that use this conversion and, therefore, no state
     information about the conversion itself must be stored in here.
     If a module implements more than one conversion, the `gconv_init'
     function will be called multiple times.

`gconv_end'
     The `gconv_end' function is responsible for freeing all resources
     allocated by the `gconv_init' function.  If there is nothing to do,
     this function can be missing.  Special care must be taken if the
     module implements more than one conversion and the `gconv_init'
     function does not allocate the same resources for all conversions.

`gconv'
     This is the actual conversion function.  It is called to convert
     one block of text.  It gets passed the conversion step information
     initialized by `gconv_init' and the conversion data, specific to
     this use of the conversion functions.

   There are three data types defined for the three module interface
functions and these define the interface.

 - Data type: int (*__gconv_init_fct) (struct __gconv_step *)
     This specifies the interface of the initialization function of the
     module.  It is called exactly once for each conversion the module
     implements.

     As explained in the description of the `struct __gconv_step' data
     structure above the initialization function has to initialize
     parts of it.

    `__min_needed_from'
    `__max_needed_from'
    `__min_needed_to'
    `__max_needed_to'
          These elements must be initialized to the exact numbers of
          the minimum and maximum number of bytes used by one character
          in the source and destination character sets, respectively.
          If the characters all have the same size, the minimum and
          maximum values are the same.

    `__stateful'
          This element must be initialized to an nonzero value if the
          source character set is stateful.  Otherwise it must be zero.

     If the initialization function needs to communicate some
     information to the conversion function, this communication can
     happen using the `__data' element of the `__gconv_step' structure.
     But since this data is shared by all the conversions, it must not
     be modified by the conversion function.  The example below shows
     how this can be used.

          #define MIN_NEEDED_FROM         1
          #define MAX_NEEDED_FROM         4
          #define MIN_NEEDED_TO           4
          #define MAX_NEEDED_TO           4
          
          int
          gconv_init (struct __gconv_step *step)
          {
            /* Determine which direction.  */
            struct iso2022jp_data *new_data;
            enum direction dir = illegal_dir;
            enum variant var = illegal_var;
            int result;
          
            if (__strcasecmp (step->__from_name, "ISO-2022-JP//") == 0)
              {
                dir = from_iso2022jp;
                var = iso2022jp;
              }
            else if (__strcasecmp (step->__to_name, "ISO-2022-JP//") == 0)
              {
                dir = to_iso2022jp;
                var = iso2022jp;
              }
            else if (__strcasecmp (step->__from_name, "ISO-2022-JP-2//") == 0)
              {
                dir = from_iso2022jp;
                var = iso2022jp2;
              }
            else if (__strcasecmp (step->__to_name, "ISO-2022-JP-2//") == 0)
              {
                dir = to_iso2022jp;
                var = iso2022jp2;
              }
          
            result = __GCONV_NOCONV;
            if (dir != illegal_dir)
              {
                new_data = (struct iso2022jp_data *)
                  malloc (sizeof (struct iso2022jp_data));
          
                result = __GCONV_NOMEM;
                if (new_data != NULL)
                  {
                    new_data->dir = dir;
                    new_data->var = var;
                    step->__data = new_data;
          
                    if (dir == from_iso2022jp)
                      {
                        step->__min_needed_from = MIN_NEEDED_FROM;
                        step->__max_needed_from = MAX_NEEDED_FROM;
                        step->__min_needed_to = MIN_NEEDED_TO;
                        step->__max_needed_to = MAX_NEEDED_TO;
                      }
                    else
                      {
                        step->__min_needed_from = MIN_NEEDED_TO;
                        step->__max_needed_from = MAX_NEEDED_TO;
                        step->__min_needed_to = MIN_NEEDED_FROM;
                        step->__max_needed_to = MAX_NEEDED_FROM + 2;
                      }
          
                    /* Yes, this is a stateful encoding.  */
                    step->__stateful = 1;
          
                    result = __GCONV_OK;
                  }
              }
          
            return result;
          }

     The function first checks which conversion is wanted.  The module
     from which this function is taken implements four different
     conversions; which one is selected can be determined by comparing
     the names.  The comparison should always be done without paying
     attention to the case.

     Next, a data structure, which contains the necessary information
     about which conversion is selected, is allocated.  The data
     structure `struct iso2022jp_data' is locally defined since,
     outside the module, this data is not used at all.  Please note
     that if all four conversions this modules supports are requested
     there are four data blocks.

     One interesting thing is the initialization of the `__min_' and
     `__max_' elements of the step data object.  A single ISO-2022-JP
     character can consist of one to four bytes.  Therefore the
     `MIN_NEEDED_FROM' and `MAX_NEEDED_FROM' macros are defined this
     way.  The output is always the `INTERNAL' character set (aka
     UCS-4) and therefore each character consists of exactly four
     bytes.  For the conversion from `INTERNAL' to ISO-2022-JP we have
     to take into account that escape sequences might be necessary to
     switch the character sets.  Therefore the `__max_needed_to'
     element for this direction gets assigned `MAX_NEEDED_FROM + 2'.
     This takes into account the two bytes needed for the escape
     sequences to single the switching.  The asymmetry in the maximum
     values for the two directions can be explained easily: when
     reading ISO-2022-JP text, escape sequences can be handled alone
     (i.e., it is not necessary to process a real character since the
     effect of the escape sequence can be recorded in the state
     information).  The situation is different for the other direction.
     Since it is in general not known which character comes next, one
     cannot emit escape sequences to change the state in advance.  This
     means the escape sequences that have to be emitted together with
     the next character.  Therefore one needs more room than only for
     the character itself.

     The possible return values of the initialization function are:

    `__GCONV_OK'
          The initialization succeeded

    `__GCONV_NOCONV'
          The requested conversion is not supported in the module.
          This can happen if the `gconv-modules' file has errors.

    `__GCONV_NOMEM'
          Memory required to store additional information could not be
          allocated.

   The function called before the module is unloaded is significantly
easier.  It often has nothing at all to do; in which case it can be left
out completely.

 - Data type: void (*__gconv_end_fct) (struct gconv_step *)
     The task of this function is to free all resources allocated in the
     initialization function.  Therefore only the `__data' element of
     the object pointed to by the argument is of interest.  Continuing
     the example from the initialization function, the finalization
     function looks like this:

          void
          gconv_end (struct __gconv_step *data)
          {
            free (data->__data);
          }

   The most important function is the conversion function itself, which
can get quite complicated for complex character sets.  But since this
is not of interest here, we will only describe a possible skeleton for
the conversion function.

 - Data type: int (*__gconv_fct) (struct __gconv_step *, struct
          __gconv_step_data *, const char **, const char *, size_t *,
          int)
     The conversion function can be called for two basic reason: to
     convert text or to reset the state.  From the description of the
     `iconv' function it can be seen why the flushing mode is
     necessary.  What mode is selected is determined by the sixth
     argument, an integer.  This argument being nonzero means that
     flushing is selected.

     Common to both modes is where the output buffer can be found.  The
     information about this buffer is stored in the conversion step
     data.  A pointer to this information is passed as the second
     argument to this function.  The description of the `struct
     __gconv_step_data' structure has more information on the
     conversion step data.

     What has to be done for flushing depends on the source character
     set.  If the source character set is not stateful, nothing has to
     be done.  Otherwise the function has to emit a byte sequence to
     bring the state object into the initial state.  Once this all
     happened the other conversion modules in the chain of conversions
     have to get the same chance.  Whether another step follows can be
     determined from the `__is_last' element of the step data structure
     to which the first parameter points.

     The more interesting mode is when actual text has to be converted.
     The first step in this case is to convert as much text as
     possible from the input buffer and store the result in the output
     buffer.  The start of the input buffer is determined by the third
     argument, which is a pointer to a pointer variable referencing the
     beginning of the buffer.  The fourth argument is a pointer to the
     byte right after the last byte in the buffer.

     The conversion has to be performed according to the current state
     if the character set is stateful.  The state is stored in an
     object pointed to by the `__statep' element of the step data
     (second argument).  Once either the input buffer is empty or the
     output buffer is full the conversion stops.  At this point, the
     pointer variable referenced by the third parameter must point to
     the byte following the last processed byte (i.e., if all of the
     input is consumed, this pointer and the fourth parameter have the
     same value).

     What now happens depends on whether this step is the last one.  If
     it is the last step, the only thing that has to be done is to
     update the `__outbuf' element of the step data structure to point
     after the last written byte.  This update gives the caller the
     information on how much text is available in the output buffer.
     In addition, the variable pointed to by the fifth parameter, which
     is of type `size_t', must be incremented by the number of
     characters (_not bytes_) that were converted in a non-reversible
     way.  Then, the function can return.

     In case the step is not the last one, the later conversion
     functions have to get a chance to do their work.  Therefore, the
     appropriate conversion function has to be called.  The information
     about the functions is stored in the conversion data structures,
     passed as the first parameter.  This information and the step data
     are stored in arrays, so the next element in both cases can be
     found by simple pointer arithmetic:

          int
          gconv (struct __gconv_step *step, struct __gconv_step_data *data,
                 const char **inbuf, const char *inbufend, size_t *written,
                 int do_flush)
          {
            struct __gconv_step *next_step = step + 1;
            struct __gconv_step_data *next_data = data + 1;
            ...

     The `next_step' pointer references the next step information and
     `next_data' the next data record.  The call of the next function
     therefore will look similar to this:

            next_step->__fct (next_step, next_data, &outerr, outbuf,
                              written, 0)

     But this is not yet all.  Once the function call returns the
     conversion function might have some more to do.  If the return
     value of the function is `__GCONV_EMPTY_INPUT', more room is
     available in the output buffer.  Unless the input buffer is empty
     the conversion, functions start all over again and process the
     rest of the input buffer.  If the return value is not
     `__GCONV_EMPTY_INPUT', something went wrong and we have to recover
     from this.

     A requirement for the conversion function is that the input buffer
     pointer (the third argument) always point to the last character
     that was put in converted form into the output buffer.  This is
     trivially true after the conversion performed in the current step,
     but if the conversion functions deeper downstream stop
     prematurely, not all characters from the output buffer are
     consumed and, therefore, the input buffer pointers must be backed
     off to the right position.

     Correcting the input buffers is easy to do if the input and output
     character sets have a fixed width for all characters.  In this
     situation we can compute how many characters are left in the
     output buffer and, therefore, can correct the input buffer pointer
     appropriately with a similar computation.  Things are getting
     tricky if either character set has characters represented with
     variable length byte sequences, and it gets even more complicated
     if the conversion has to take care of the state.  In these cases
     the conversion has to be performed once again, from the known
     state before the initial conversion (i.e., if necessary the state
     of the conversion has to be reset and the conversion loop has to be
     executed again).  The difference now is that it is known how much
     input must be created, and the conversion can stop before
     converting the first unused character.  Once this is done the
     input buffer pointers must be updated again and the function can
     return.

     One final thing should be mentioned.  If it is necessary for the
     conversion to know whether it is the first invocation (in case a
     prolog has to be emitted), the conversion function should
     increment the `__invocation_counter' element of the step data
     structure just before returning to the caller.  See the
     description of the `struct __gconv_step_data' structure above for
     more information on how this can be used.

     The return value must be one of the following values:

    `__GCONV_EMPTY_INPUT'
          All input was consumed and there is room left in the output
          buffer.

    `__GCONV_FULL_OUTPUT'
          No more room in the output buffer.  In case this is not the
          last step this value is propagated down from the call of the
          next conversion function in the chain.

    `__GCONV_INCOMPLETE_INPUT'
          The input buffer is not entirely empty since it contains an
          incomplete character sequence.

     The following example provides a framework for a conversion
     function.  In case a new conversion has to be written the holes in
     this implementation have to be filled and that is it.

          int
          gconv (struct __gconv_step *step, struct __gconv_step_data *data,

   This information should be sufficient to write new modules.  Anybody
doing so should also take a look at the available source code in the GNU
C library sources.  It contains many examples of working and optimized
modules.

Locales and Internationalization
********************************

   Different countries and cultures have varying conventions for how to
communicate.  These conventions range from very simple ones, such as the
format for representing dates and times, to very complex ones, such as
the language spoken.

   "Internationalization" of software means programming it to be able
to adapt to the user's favorite conventions.  In ISO C,
internationalization works by means of "locales".  Each locale
specifies a collection of conventions, one convention for each purpose.
The user chooses a set of conventions by specifying a locale (via
environment variables).

   All programs inherit the chosen locale as part of their environment.
Provided the programs are written to obey the choice of locale, they
will follow the conventions preferred by the user.

* Effects of Locale::           Actions affected by the choice of
                                 locale.

What Effects a Locale Has
=========================

   Each locale specifies conventions for several purposes, including the
following:

   * What multibyte character sequences are valid, and how they are
     interpreted (*note Character Set Handling::).

   * Classification of which characters in the local character set are
     considered alphabetic, and upper- and lower-case conversion
     conventions (*note Character Handling::).

   * The collating sequence for the local language and character set
     (*note Collation Functions::).

   * Formatting of numbers and currency amounts (*note General
     Numeric::).

   * Formatting of dates and times (*note Formatting Calendar Time::).

   * What language to use for output, including error messages (*note
     Message Translation::).

   * What language to use for user answers to yes-or-no questions
     (*note Yes-or-No Questions::).

   * What language to use for more complex user input.  (The C library
     doesn't yet help you implement this.)

   Some aspects of adapting to the specified locale are handled
automatically by the library subroutines.  For example, all your program
needs to do in order to use the collating sequence of the chosen locale
is to use `strcoll' or `strxfrm' to compare strings.

   Other aspects of locales are beyond the comprehension of the library.
For example, the library can't automatically translate your program's
output messages into other languages.  The only way you can support
output in the user's favorite language is to program this more or less
by hand.  The C library provides functions to handle translations for
multiple languages easily.

   This chapter discusses the mechanism by which you can modify the
current locale.  The effects of the current locale on specific library
functions are discussed in more detail in the descriptions of those
functions.


File: libc.info,  Node: Choosing Locale,  Next: Locale Categories,  Prev: Effects of Locale,  Up: Locales

Choosing a Locale
=================

   The simplest way for the user to choose a locale is to set the
environment variable `LANG'.  This specifies a single locale to use for
all purposes.  For example, a user could specify a hypothetical locale
named `espana-castellano' to use the standard conventions of most of
Spain.

   The set of locales supported depends on the operating system you are
using, and so do their names.  We can't make any promises about what
locales will exist, except for one standard locale called `C' or
`POSIX'.  Later we will describe how to construct locales.

   A user also has the option of specifying different locales for
different purposes--in effect, choosing a mixture of multiple locales.

   For example, the user might specify the locale `espana-castellano'
for most purposes, but specify the locale `usa-english' for currency
formatting.  This might make sense if the user is a Spanish-speaking
American, working in Spanish, but representing monetary amounts in US
dollars.

   Note that both locales `espana-castellano' and `usa-english', like
all locales, would include conventions for all of the purposes to which
locales apply.  However, the user can choose to use each locale for a
particular subset of those purposes.


File: libc.info,  Node: Locale Categories,  Next: Setting the Locale,  Prev: Choosing Locale,  Up: Locales

Categories of Activities that Locales Affect
============================================

   The purposes that locales serve are grouped into "categories", so
that a user or a program can choose the locale for each category
independently.  Here is a table of categories; each name is both an
environment variable that a user can set, and a macro name that you can
use as an argument to `setlocale'.

`LC_COLLATE'
     This category applies to collation of strings (functions `strcoll'
     and `strxfrm'); see *Note Collation Functions::.

`LC_CTYPE'
     This category applies to classification and conversion of
     characters, and to multibyte and wide characters; see *Note
     Character Handling::, and *Note Character Set Handling::.

`LC_MONETARY'
     This category applies to formatting monetary values; see *Note
     General Numeric::.

`LC_NUMERIC'
     This category applies to formatting numeric values that are not
     monetary; see *Note General Numeric::.

`LC_TIME'
     This category applies to formatting date and time values; see
     *Note Formatting Calendar Time::.

`LC_MESSAGES'
     This category applies to selecting the language used in the user
     interface for message translation (*note The Uniforum approach::;
     *note Message catalogs a la X/Open::)  and contains regular
     expressions for affirmative and negative responses.

`LC_ALL'
     This is not an environment variable; it is only a macro that you
     can use with `setlocale' to set a single locale for all purposes.
     Setting this environment variable overwrites all selections by the
     other `LC_*' variables or `LANG'.

`LANG'
     If this environment variable is defined, its value specifies the
     locale to use for all purposes except as overridden by the
     variables above.

   When developing the message translation functions it was felt that
the functionality provided by the variables above is not sufficient.
For example, it should be possible to specify more than one locale name.
Take a Swedish user who better speaks German than English, and a program
whose messages are output in English by default.  It should be possible
to specify that the first choice of language is Swedish, the second
German, and if this also fails to use English.  This is possible with
the variable `LANGUAGE'.  For further description of this GNU extension
see *Note Using gettextized software::.
