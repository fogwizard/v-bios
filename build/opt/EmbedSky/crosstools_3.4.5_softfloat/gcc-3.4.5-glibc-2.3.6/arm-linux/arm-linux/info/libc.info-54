Installing the GNU C Library
****************************

   Before you do anything else, you should read the file `FAQ' located
at the top level of the source tree.  This file answers common questions
and describes problems you may experience with compilation and
installation.  It is updated more frequently than this manual.

   Features can be added to GNU Libc via "add-on" bundles.  These are
separate tar files, which you unpack into the top level of the source
tree.  Then you give `configure' the `--enable-add-ons' option to
activate them, and they will be compiled into the library.  As of the
2.2 release, one important component of glibc is distributed as
"official" add-ons: the linuxthreads add-on.  Unless you are doing an
unusual installation, you should get this.

   Support for POSIX threads is maintained by someone else, so it's in a
separate package.  It is only available for GNU/Linux systems, but this
will change in the future.  Get it from the same place you got the main
bundle; the file is `glibc-linuxthreads-VERSION.tar.gz'.

   You will need recent versions of several GNU tools: definitely GCC
and GNU Make, and possibly others.  *Note Tools for Compilation::,

Configuring and compiling GNU Libc
==================================

   GNU libc can be compiled in the source directory, but we strongly
advise building it in a separate build directory.  For example, if you
have  unpacked the glibc sources in `/src/gnu/glibc-2.3', create a
directory `/src/gnu/glibc-build' to put the object files in.  This
allows removing the whole build directory in case an error occurs,
which is the safest way to get a fresh start and should always be done.

   From your object directory, run the shell script `configure' located
at the top level of the source tree.  In the scenario above, you'd type

     $ ../glibc-2.3/configure ARGS...

   Please note that even if you're building in a separate build
directory, the compilation needs to modify a few files in the source
directory, especially some files in the manual subdirectory.

`configure' takes many options, but you can get away with knowing only
two: `--prefix' and `--enable-add-ons'.  The `--prefix' option tells
`configure' where you want glibc installed. This defaults to
`/usr/local'.  The `--enable-add-ons' option tells `configure' to use
all the add-on bundles it finds in the source directory.  Since
important functionality is provided in add-ons, you should always
specify this option.

   It may also be useful to set the CC and CFLAGS variables in the
environment when running `configure'.  CC selects the C compiler that
will be used, and CFLAGS sets optimization options for the compiler.

   The following list describes all of the available options for
`configure':

`--prefix=DIRECTORY'
     Install machine-independent data files in subdirectories of
     `DIRECTORY'.  The default is to install in `/usr/local'.

`--exec-prefix=DIRECTORY'
     Install the library and other machine-dependent files in
     subdirectories of `DIRECTORY'.  The default is to the `--prefix'
     directory if that option is specified, or `/usr/local' otherwise.

`--with-headers=DIRECTORY'
     Look for kernel header files in DIRECTORY, not `/usr/include'.
     Glibc needs information from the kernel's private header files.
     Glibc will normally look in `/usr/include' for them, but if you
     specify this option, it will look in DIRECTORY instead.

     This option is primarily of use on a system where the headers in
     `/usr/include' come from an older version of glibc.  Conflicts can
     occasionally happen in this case.  Note that Linux libc5 qualifies
     as an older version of glibc.  You can also use this option if you
     want to compile glibc with a newer set of kernel headers than the
     ones found in `/usr/include'.

`--enable-add-ons[=LIST]'
     Enable add-on packages in your source tree.  If this option is
     specified with no list, it enables all the add-on packages it
     finds.  If you do not wish to use some add-on packages that you
     have present in your source tree, give this option a list of the
     add-ons that you _do_ want used, like this:
     `--enable-add-ons=linuxthreads'

`--enable-kernel=VERSION'
     This option is currently only useful on GNU/Linux systems.  The
     VERSION parameter should have the form X.Y.Z and describes the
     smallest version of the Linux kernel the generated library is
     expected to support.  The higher the VERSION number is, the less
     compatibility code is added, and the faster the code gets.

`--with-binutils=DIRECTORY'
     Use the binutils (assembler and linker) in `DIRECTORY', not the
     ones the C compiler would default to.  You can use this option if
     the default binutils on your system cannot deal with all the
     constructs in the GNU C library.  In that case, `configure' will
     detect the problem and suppress these constructs, so that the
     library will still be usable, but functionality may be lost--for
     example, you can't build a shared libc with old binutils.

`--without-fp'
     Use this option if your computer lacks hardware floating-point
     support and your operating system does not emulate an FPU.

     these

`--disable-shared'
     Don't build shared libraries even if it is possible.  Not all
     systems support shared libraries; you need ELF support and
     (currently) the GNU linker.

`--disable-profile'
     Don't build libraries with profiling information.  You may want to
     use this option if you don't plan to do profiling.

`--enable-omitfp'
     Use maximum optimization for the normal (static and shared)
     libraries, and compile separate static libraries with debugging
     information and no optimization.  We recommend not doing this.
     The extra optimization doesn't gain you much, it may provoke
     compiler bugs, and you won't be able to trace bugs through the C
     library.

`--disable-versioning'
     Don't compile the shared libraries with symbol version information.
     Doing this will make the resulting library incompatible with old
     binaries, so it's not recommended.

`--enable-static-nss'
     Compile static versions of the NSS (Name Service Switch) libraries.
     This is not recommended because it defeats the purpose of NSS; a
     program linked statically with the NSS libraries cannot be
     dynamically reconfigured to use a different name database.

`--without-tls'
     By default the C library is built with support for thread-local
     storage if the used tools support it.  By using `--without-tls'
     this can be prevented though there generally is no reason since it
     creates compatibility problems.

`--build=BUILD-SYSTEM'
`--host=HOST-SYSTEM'
     These options are for cross-compiling.  If you specify both
     options and BUILD-SYSTEM is different from HOST-SYSTEM, `configure'
     will prepare to cross-compile glibc from BUILD-SYSTEM to be used
     on HOST-SYSTEM.  You'll probably need the `--with-headers' option
     too, and you may have to override CONFIGURE's selection of the
     compiler and/or binutils.

     If you only specify `--host', `configure' will prepare for a
     native compile but use what you specify instead of guessing what
     your system is. This is most useful to change the CPU submodel.
     For example, if `configure' guesses your machine as
     `i586-pc-linux-gnu' but you want to compile a library for 386es,
     give `--host=i386-pc-linux-gnu' or just `--host=i386-linux' and add
     the appropriate compiler flags (`-mcpu=i386' will do the trick) to
     CFLAGS.

     If you specify just `--build', `configure' will get confused.

   To build the library and related programs, type `make'.  This will
produce a lot of output, some of which may look like errors from `make'
but isn't.  Look for error messages from `make' containing `***'.
Those indicate that something is seriously wrong.

   The compilation process can take several hours.  Expect at least two
hours for the default configuration on i586 for GNU/Linux.  For Hurd,
times are much longer.  Some complex modules may take a very long time
to compile, as much as several minutes on slower machines.  Do not
panic if the compiler appears to hang.

   If you want to run a parallel make, simply pass the `-j' option with
an appropriate numeric parameter to `make'.  You need a recent GNU
`make' version, though.

   To build and run test programs which exercise some of the library
facilities, type `make check'.  If it does not complete successfully,
do not use the built library, and report a bug after verifying that the
problem is not already known.  *Note Reporting Bugs::, for instructions
on reporting bugs.  Note that some of the tests assume they are not
being run by `root'.  We recommend you compile and test glibc as an
unprivileged user.

   Before reporting bugs make sure there is no problem with your system.
The tests (and later installation) use some pre-existing files of the
system such as `/etc/passwd', `/etc/nsswitch.conf' and others.  These
files must all contain correct and sensible content.

   To format the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' for printing, type
`make dvi'.  You need a working TeX installation to do this.  The
distribution already includes the on-line formatted version of the
manual, as Info files.  You can regenerate those with `make info', but
it shouldn't be necessary.

   The library has a number of special-purpose configuration parameters
which you can find in `Makeconfig'.  These can be overwritten with the
file `configparms'.  To change them, create a `configparms' in your
build directory and add values as appropriate for your system.  The
file is included and parsed by `make' and has to follow the conventions
for makefiles.

   It is easy to configure the GNU C library for cross-compilation by
setting a few variables in `configparms'.  Set `CC' to the
cross-compiler for the target you configured the library for; it is
important to use this same `CC' value when running `configure', like
this: `CC=TARGET-gcc configure TARGET'.  Set `BUILD_CC' to the compiler
to use for programs run on the build system as part of compiling the
library.  You may need to set `AR' and `RANLIB' to cross-compiling
versions of `ar' and `ranlib' if the native tools are not configured to
work with object files for the target you configured for.

Installing the C Library
========================

   To install the library and its header files, and the Info files of
the manual, type `env LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C make install'.  This will
build things, if necessary, before installing them; however, you should
still compile everything first.  If you are installing glibc as your
primary C library, we recommend that you shut the system down to
single-user mode first, and reboot afterward.  This minimizes the risk
of breaking things when the library changes out from underneath.

   If you're upgrading from Linux libc5 or some other C library, you
need to replace the `/usr/include' with a fresh directory before
installing it.  The new `/usr/include' should contain the Linux
headers, but nothing else.

   You must first build the library (`make'), optionally check it
(`make check'), switch the include directories and then install (`make
install').  The steps must be done in this order.  Not moving the
directory before install will result in an unusable mixture of header
files from both libraries, but configuring, building, and checking the
library requires the ability to compile and run programs against the old
library.

   If you are upgrading from a previous installation of glibc 2.0 or
2.1, `make install' will do the entire job.  You do not need to remove
the old includes - if you want to do so anyway you must then follow the
order given above.

   You may also need to reconfigure GCC to work with the new library.
The easiest way to do that is to figure out the compiler switches to
make it work again (`-Wl,--dynamic-linker=/lib/ld-linux.so.2' should
work on GNU/Linux systems) and use them to recompile gcc.  You can also
edit the specs file (`/usr/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION/specs'), but that
is a bit of a black art.

   You can install glibc somewhere other than where you configured it
to go by setting the `install_root' variable on the command line for
`make install'.  The value of this variable is prepended to all the
paths for installation.  This is useful when setting up a chroot
environment or preparing a binary distribution.  The directory should be
specified with an absolute file name.

   Glibc 2.2 includes a daemon called `nscd', which you may or may not
want to run.  `nscd' caches name service lookups; it can dramatically
improve performance with NIS+, and may help with DNS as well.

   One auxiliary program, `/usr/libexec/pt_chown', is installed setuid
`root'.  This program is invoked by the `grantpt' function; it sets the
permissions on a pseudoterminal so it can be used by the calling
process.  This means programs like `xterm' and `screen' do not have to
be setuid to get a pty.  (There may be other reasons why they need
privileges.)  If you are using a 2.1 or newer Linux kernel with the
`devptsfs' or `devfs' filesystems providing pty slaves, you don't need
this program; otherwise you do.  The source for `pt_chown' is in
`login/programs/pt_chown.c'.

   After installation you might want to configure the timezone and
locale installation of your system.  The GNU C library comes with a
locale database which gets configured with `localedef'.  For example, to
set up a German locale with name `de_DE', simply issue the command
`localedef -i de_DE -f ISO-8859-1 de_DE'.  To configure all locales
that are supported by glibc, you can issue from your build directory the
command `make localedata/install-locales'.

   To configure the locally used timezone, set the `TZ' environment
variable.  The script `tzselect' helps you to select the right value.
As an example, for Germany, `tzselect' would tell you to use
`TZ='Europe/Berlin''.  For a system wide installation (the given paths
are for an installation with `--prefix=/usr'), link the timezone file
which is in `/usr/share/zoneinfo' to the file `/etc/localtime'.  For
Germany, you might execute `ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin
/etc/localtime'.

Recommended Tools for Compilation
=================================

   We recommend installing the following GNU tools before attempting to
build the GNU C library:

   * GNU `make' 3.79 or newer

     You need the latest version of GNU `make'.  Modifying the GNU C
     Library to work with other `make' programs would be so difficult
     that we recommend you port GNU `make' instead.  *Really.*  We
     recommend GNU `make' version 3.79.  All earlier versions have
     severe bugs or lack features.

   * GCC 3.2 or newer

     The GNU C library can only be compiled with the GNU C compiler
     family.  As of the 2.3 release, GCC 3.2 or higher is required.  As
     of this writing, GCC 3.2 is the compiler we advise to use.

     You can use whatever compiler you like to compile programs that
     use GNU libc, but be aware that both GCC 2.7 and 2.8 have bugs in
     their floating-point support that may be triggered by the math
     library.

     Check the FAQ for any special compiler issues on particular
     platforms.

   * GNU `binutils' 2.13 or later

     You must use GNU `binutils' (as and ld) to build the GNU C library.
     No other assembler or linker has the necessary functionality at the
     moment.

   * GNU `texinfo' 3.12f

     To correctly translate and install the Texinfo documentation you
     need this version of the `texinfo' package.  Earlier versions do
     not understand all the tags used in the document, and the
     installation mechanism for the info files is not present or works
     differently.

   * GNU `awk' 3.0, or some other POSIX awk

     `Awk' is used in several places to generate files.  The scripts
     should work with any POSIX-compliant `awk' implementation; `gawk'
     3.0 and `mawk' 1.3 are known to work.

   * Perl 5

     Perl is not required, but it is used if present to test the
     installation.  We may decide to use it elsewhere in the future.

   * GNU `sed' 3.02 or newer

     `Sed' is used in several places to generate files.  Most scripts
     work with any version of `sed'.  The known exception is the script
     `po2test.sed' in the `intl' subdirectory which is used to generate
     `msgs.h' for the test suite.  This script works correctly only
     with GNU `sed' 3.02.  If you like to run the test suite, you
     should definitely upgrade `sed'.


If you change any of the `configure.in' files you will also need

   * GNU `autoconf' 2.53 or higher

and if you change any of the message translation files you will need

   * GNU `gettext' 0.10.36 or later

You may also need these packages if you upgrade your source tree using
patches, although we try to avoid this.

Supported Configurations
========================

   The GNU C Library currently supports configurations that match the
following patterns:

     alpha*-*-linux
     arm-*-linux
     cris-*-linux
     hppa-*-linux
     iX86-*-gnu
     iX86-*-linux
     ia64-*-linux
     m68k-*-linux
     mips*-*-linux
     powerpc-*-linux
     s390-*-linux
     s390x-*-linux
     sparc-*-linux
     sparc64-*-linux
     x86_64-*-linux

   Former releases of this library (version 2.1 and/or 2.0) used to run
on the following configurations:

     arm-*-linuxaout
     arm-*-none

   Very early releases (version 1.09.1 and perhaps earlier versions)
used to run on the following configurations:

     alpha-dec-osf1
     alpha-*-linuxecoff
     iX86-*-bsd4.3
     iX86-*-isc2.2
     iX86-*-isc3.N
     iX86-*-sco3.2
     iX86-*-sco3.2v4
     iX86-*-sysv
     iX86-*-sysv4
     iX86-force_cpu386-none
     iX86-sequent-bsd
     i960-nindy960-none
     m68k-hp-bsd4.3
     m68k-mvme135-none
     m68k-mvme136-none
     m68k-sony-newsos3
     m68k-sony-newsos4
     m68k-sun-sunos4.N
     mips-dec-ultrix4.N
     mips-sgi-irix4.N
     sparc-sun-solaris2.N
     sparc-sun-sunos4.N

   Since no one has volunteered to test and fix these configurations,
they are not supported at the moment.  They probably don't compile;
they definitely don't work anymore.  Porting the library is not hard.
If you are interested in doing a port, please contact the glibc
maintainers.  Start at <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> and read the
references there on how to go about getting involved and contacting the
developers.

   Valid cases of `iX86' include `i386', `i486', `i586', and `i686'.
All of those configurations produce a library that can run on this
processor and newer processors.  The GCC compiler by default generates
code that's optimized for the machine it's configured for and will use
the instructions available on that machine.  For example if your GCC is
configured for `i686', gcc will optimize for `i686' and might issue
some `i686' specific instructions.  To generate code for other models,
you have to configure for that model and give GCC the appropriate
`-march=' and `-mcpu=' compiler switches via CFLAGS.

Specific advice for GNU/Linux systems
=====================================

   If you are installing GNU libc on a GNU/Linux system, you need to
have the header files from a 2.2 or newer kernel around for reference.
For some architectures, like ia64, sh and hppa, you need at least
headers from kernel 2.3.99 (sh and hppa) or 2.4.0 (ia64).  You do not
need to use that kernel, just have its headers where glibc can access
at them.  The easiest way to do this is to unpack it in a directory
such as `/usr/src/linux-2.2.1'.  In that directory, run `make config'
and accept all the defaults.  Then run `make include/linux/version.h'.
Finally, configure glibc with the option
`--with-headers=/usr/src/linux-2.2.1/include'.  Use the most recent
kernel you can get your hands on.

   An alternate tactic is to unpack the 2.2 kernel and run `make
config' as above; then, rename or delete `/usr/include', create a new
`/usr/include', and make symbolic links of `/usr/include/linux' and
`/usr/include/asm' into the kernel sources.  You can then configure
glibc with no special options.  This tactic is recommended if you are
upgrading from libc5, since you need to get rid of the old header files
anyway.

   After installing GNU libc, you may need to remove or rename
`/usr/include/linux' and `/usr/include/asm', and replace them with
copies of `include/linux' and `include/asm-$ARCHITECTURE' taken from
the Linux source package which supplied kernel headers for building the
library.  ARCHITECTURE will be the machine architecture for which the
library was built, such as `i386' or `alpha'.  You do not need to do
this if you did not specify an alternate kernel header source using
`--with-headers'.  The intent here is that these directories should be
copies of, *not* symlinks to, the kernel headers used to build the
library.

   Note that `/usr/include/net' and `/usr/include/scsi' should *not* be
symlinks into the kernel sources.  GNU libc provides its own versions
of these files.

   GNU/Linux expects some components of the libc installation to be in
`/lib' and some in `/usr/lib'.  This is handled automatically if you
configure glibc with `--prefix=/usr'.  If you set some other prefix or
allow it to default to `/usr/local', then all the components are
installed there.

   If you are upgrading from libc5, you need to recompile every shared
library on your system against the new library for the sake of new code,
but keep the old libraries around for old binaries to use.  This is
complicated and difficult.  Consult the Glibc2 HOWTO at
<http://www.imaxx.net/~thrytis/glibc> for details.

   You cannot use `nscd' with 2.0 kernels, due to bugs in the
kernel-side thread support.  `nscd' happens to hit these bugs
particularly hard, but you might have problems with any threaded
program.

Reporting Bugs
==============

   There are probably bugs in the GNU C library.  There are certainly
errors and omissions in this manual.  If you report them, they will get
fixed.  If you don't, no one will ever know about them and they will
remain unfixed for all eternity, if not longer.

   It is a good idea to verify that the problem has not already been
reported.  Bugs are documented in two places: The file `BUGS' describes
a number of well known bugs and the bug tracking system has a WWW
interface at <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/>.  The WWW interface
gives you access to open and closed reports.  A closed report normally
includes a patch or a hint on solving the problem.

   To report a bug, first you must find it.  With any luck, this will
be the hard part.  Once you've found a bug, make sure it's really a
bug.  A good way to do this is to see if the GNU C library behaves the
same way some other C library does.  If so, probably you are wrong and
the libraries are right (but not necessarily).  If not, one of the
libraries is probably wrong.  It might not be the GNU library.  Many
historical Unix C libraries permit things that we don't, such as
closing a file twice.

   If you think you have found some way in which the GNU C library does
not conform to the ISO and POSIX standards (*note Standards and
Portability::), that is definitely a bug.  Report it!

   Once you're sure you've found a bug, try to narrow it down to the
smallest test case that reproduces the problem.  In the case of a C
library, you really only need to narrow it down to one library function
call, if possible.  This should not be too difficult.

   The final step when you have a simple test case is to report the bug.
Do this using the WWW interface to the bug database.

   If you are not sure how a function should behave, and this manual
doesn't tell you, that's a bug in the manual.  Report that too!  If the
function's behavior disagrees with the manual, then either the library
or the manual has a bug, so report the disagreement.  If you find any
errors or omissions in this manual, please report them to the bug
database.  If you refer to specific sections of the manual, please
include the section names for easier identification.

Adding New Functions
====================

   The process of building the library is driven by the makefiles, which
make heavy use of special features of GNU `make'.  The makefiles are
very complex, and you probably don't want to try to understand them.
But what they do is fairly straightforward, and only requires that you
define a few variables in the right places.

   The library sources are divided into subdirectories, grouped by
topic.

   The `string' subdirectory has all the string-manipulation functions,
`math' has all the mathematical functions, etc.

   Each subdirectory contains a simple makefile, called `Makefile',
which defines a few `make' variables and then includes the global
makefile `Rules' with a line like:

     include ../Rules

The basic variables that a subdirectory makefile defines are:

`subdir'
     The name of the subdirectory, for example `stdio'.  This variable
     *must* be defined.

`headers'
     The names of the header files in this section of the library, such
     as `stdio.h'.

`routines'
`aux'
     The names of the modules (source files) in this section of the
     library.  These should be simple names, such as `strlen' (rather
     than complete file names, such as `strlen.c').  Use `routines' for
     modules that define functions in the library, and `aux' for
     auxiliary modules containing things like data definitions.  But the
     values of `routines' and `aux' are just concatenated, so there
     really is no practical difference.

`tests'
     The names of test programs for this section of the library.  These
     should be simple names, such as `tester' (rather than complete file
     names, such as `tester.c').  `make tests' will build and run all
     the test programs.  If a test program needs input, put the test
     data in a file called `TEST-PROGRAM.input'; it will be given to
     the test program on its standard input.  If a test program wants
     to be run with arguments, put the arguments (all on a single line)
     in a file called `TEST-PROGRAM.args'.  Test programs should exit
     with zero status when the test passes, and nonzero status when the
     test indicates a bug in the library or error in building.

`others'
     The names of "other" programs associated with this section of the
     library.  These are programs which are not tests per se, but are
     other small programs included with the library.  They are built by
     `make others'.

`install-lib'
`install-data'
`install'
     Files to be installed by `make install'.  Files listed in
     `install-lib' are installed in the directory specified by `libdir'
     in `configparms' or `Makeconfig' (*note Installation::).  Files
     listed in `install-data' are installed in the directory specified
     by `datadir' in `configparms' or `Makeconfig'.  Files listed in
     `install' are installed in the directory specified by `bindir' in
     `configparms' or `Makeconfig'.

`distribute'
     Other files from this subdirectory which should be put into a
     distribution tar file.  You need not list here the makefile itself
     or the source and header files listed in the other standard
     variables.  Only define `distribute' if there are files used in an
     unusual way that should go into the distribution.

`generated'
     Files which are generated by `Makefile' in this subdirectory.
     These files will be removed by `make clean', and they will never
     go into a distribution.

`extra-objs'
     Extra object files which are built by `Makefile' in this
     subdirectory.  This should be a list of file names like `foo.o';
     the files will actually be found in whatever directory object
     files are being built in.  These files will be removed by
     `make clean'.  This variable is used for secondary object files
     needed to build `others' or `tests'.

Porting the GNU C Library
=========================

   The GNU C library is written to be easily portable to a variety of
machines and operating systems.  Machine- and operating system-dependent
functions are well separated to make it easy to add implementations for
new machines or operating systems.  This section describes the layout of
the library source tree and explains the mechanisms used to select
machine-dependent code to use.

   All the machine-dependent and operating system-dependent files in the
library are in the subdirectory `sysdeps' under the top-level library
source directory.  This directory contains a hierarchy of
subdirectories (*note Hierarchy Conventions::).

   Each subdirectory of `sysdeps' contains source files for a
particular machine or operating system, or for a class of machine or
operating system (for example, systems by a particular vendor, or all
machines that use IEEE 754 floating-point format).  A configuration
specifies an ordered list of these subdirectories.  Each subdirectory
implicitly appends its parent directory to the list.  For example,
specifying the list `unix/bsd/vax' is equivalent to specifying the list
`unix/bsd/vax unix/bsd unix'.  A subdirectory can also specify that it
implies other subdirectories which are not directly above it in the
directory hierarchy.  If the file `Implies' exists in a subdirectory,
it lists other subdirectories of `sysdeps' which are appended to the
list, appearing after the subdirectory containing the `Implies' file.
Lines in an `Implies' file that begin with a `#' character are ignored
as comments.  For example, `unix/bsd/Implies' contains:
     # BSD has Internet-related things.
     unix/inet

and `unix/Implies' contains:
     posix

So the final list is `unix/bsd/vax unix/bsd unix/inet unix posix'.

   `sysdeps' has a "special" subdirectory called `generic'.  It is
always implicitly appended to the list of subdirectories, so you
needn't put it in an `Implies' file, and you should not create any
subdirectories under it intended to be new specific categories.
`generic' serves two purposes.  First, the makefiles do not bother to
look for a system-dependent version of a file that's not in `generic'.
This means that any system-dependent source file must have an analogue
in `generic', even if the routines defined by that file are not
implemented on other platforms.  Second. the `generic' version of a
system-dependent file is used if the makefiles do not find a version
specific to the system you're compiling for.

   If it is possible to implement the routines in a `generic' file in
machine-independent C, using only other machine-independent functions in
the C library, then you should do so.  Otherwise, make them stubs.  A
"stub" function is a function which cannot be implemented on a
particular machine or operating system.  Stub functions always return an
error, and set `errno' to `ENOSYS' (Function not implemented).  *Note
Error Reporting::.  If you define a stub function, you must place the
statement `stub_warning(FUNCTION)', where FUNCTION is the name of your
function, after its definition; also, you must include the file
`<stub-tag.h>' into your file.  This causes the function to be listed
in the installed `<gnu/stubs.h>', and makes GNU ld warn when the
function is used.

   Some rare functions are only useful on specific systems and aren't
defined at all on others; these do not appear anywhere in the
system-independent source code or makefiles (including the `generic'
directory), only in the system-dependent `Makefile' in the specific
system's subdirectory.

   If you come across a file that is in one of the main source
directories (`string', `stdio', etc.), and you want to write a machine-
or operating system-dependent version of it, move the file into
`sysdeps/generic' and write your new implementation in the appropriate
system-specific subdirectory.  Note that if a file is to be
system-dependent, it *must not* appear in one of the main source
directories.

   There are a few special files that may exist in each subdirectory of
`sysdeps':

`Makefile'
     A makefile for this machine or operating system, or class of
     machine or operating system.  This file is included by the library
     makefile `Makerules', which is used by the top-level makefile and
     the subdirectory makefiles.  It can change the variables set in the
     including makefile or add new rules.  It can use GNU `make'
     conditional directives based on the variable `subdir' (see above)
     to select different sets of variables and rules for different
     sections of the library.  It can also set the `make' variable
     `sysdep-routines', to specify extra modules to be included in the
     library.  You should use `sysdep-routines' rather than adding
     modules to `routines' because the latter is used in determining
     what to distribute for each subdirectory of the main source tree.

     Each makefile in a subdirectory in the ordered list of
     subdirectories to be searched is included in order.  Since several
     system-dependent makefiles may be included, each should append to
     `sysdep-routines' rather than simply setting it:

          sysdep-routines := $(sysdep-routines) foo bar

`Subdirs'
     This file contains the names of new whole subdirectories under the
     top-level library source tree that should be included for this
     system.  These subdirectories are treated just like the
     system-independent subdirectories in the library source tree, such
     as `stdio' and `math'.

     Use this when there are completely new sets of functions and header
     files that should go into the library for the system this
     subdirectory of `sysdeps' implements.  For example,
     `sysdeps/unix/inet/Subdirs' contains `inet'; the `inet' directory
     contains various network-oriented operations which only make sense
     to put in the library on systems that support the Internet.

`Dist'
     This file contains the names of files (relative to the
     subdirectory of `sysdeps' in which it appears) which should be
     included in the distribution.  List any new files used by rules in
     the `Makefile' in the same directory, or header files used by the
     source files in that directory.  You don't need to list files that
     are implementations (either C or assembly source) of routines
     whose names are given in the machine-independent makefiles in the
     main source tree.

`configure'
     This file is a shell script fragment to be run at configuration
     time.  The top-level `configure' script uses the shell `.' command
     to read the `configure' file in each system-dependent directory
     chosen, in order.  The `configure' files are often generated from
     `configure.in' files using Autoconf.

     A system-dependent `configure' script will usually add things to
     the shell variables `DEFS' and `config_vars'; see the top-level
     `configure' script for details.  The script can check for
     `--with-PACKAGE' options that were passed to the top-level
     `configure'.  For an option `--with-PACKAGE=VALUE' `configure'
     sets the shell variable `with_PACKAGE' (with any dashes in PACKAGE
     converted to underscores) to VALUE; if the option is just
     `--with-PACKAGE' (no argument), then it sets `with_PACKAGE' to
     `yes'.

`configure.in'
     This file is an Autoconf input fragment to be processed into the
     file `configure' in this subdirectory.  *Note Introduction:
     (autoconf.info)Introduction, for a description of Autoconf.  You
     should write either `configure' or `configure.in', but not both.
     The first line of `configure.in' should invoke the `m4' macro
     `GLIBC_PROVIDES'.  This macro does several `AC_PROVIDE' calls for
     Autoconf macros which are used by the top-level `configure'
     script; without this, those macros might be invoked again
     unnecessarily by Autoconf.

   That is the general system for how system-dependencies are isolated.

Layout of the `sysdeps' Directory Hierarchy
-------------------------------------------

   A GNU configuration name has three parts: the CPU type, the
manufacturer's name, and the operating system.  `configure' uses these
to pick the list of system-dependent directories to look for.  If the
`--nfp' option is _not_ passed to `configure', the directory
`MACHINE/fpu' is also used.  The operating system often has a "base
operating system"; for example, if the operating system is `Linux', the
base operating system is `unix/sysv'.  The algorithm used to pick the
list of directories is simple: `configure' makes a list of the base
operating system, manufacturer, CPU type, and operating system, in that
order.  It then concatenates all these together with slashes in
between, to produce a directory name; for example, the configuration
`i686-linux-gnu' results in `unix/sysv/linux/i386/i686'.  `configure'
then tries removing each element of the list in turn, so
`unix/sysv/linux' and `unix/sysv' are also tried, among others.  Since
the precise version number of the operating system is often not
important, and it would be very inconvenient, for example, to have
identical `irix6.2' and `irix6.3' directories, `configure' tries
successively less specific operating system names by removing trailing
suffixes starting with a period.

   As an example, here is the complete list of directories that would be
tried for the configuration `i686-linux-gnu' (with the `crypt' and
`linuxthreads' add-on):

     sysdeps/i386/elf
     crypt/sysdeps/unix
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/pthread
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/unix/sysv
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/unix
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/i386/i686
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/i386
     linuxthreads/sysdeps/pthread/no-cmpxchg
     sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386
     sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux
     sysdeps/gnu
     sysdeps/unix/common
     sysdeps/unix/mman
     sysdeps/unix/inet
     sysdeps/unix/sysv/i386/i686
     sysdeps/unix/sysv/i386
     sysdeps/unix/sysv
     sysdeps/unix/i386
     sysdeps/unix
     sysdeps/posix
     sysdeps/i386/i686
     sysdeps/i386/i486
     sysdeps/libm-i387/i686
     sysdeps/i386/fpu
     sysdeps/libm-i387
     sysdeps/i386
     sysdeps/wordsize-32
     sysdeps/ieee754
     sysdeps/libm-ieee754
     sysdeps/generic

   Different machine architectures are conventionally subdirectories at
the top level of the `sysdeps' directory tree.  For example,
`sysdeps/sparc' and `sysdeps/m68k'.  These contain files specific to
those machine architectures, but not specific to any particular
operating system.  There might be subdirectories for specializations of
those architectures, such as `sysdeps/m68k/68020'. Code which is
specific to the floating-point coprocessor used with a particular
machine should go in `sysdeps/MACHINE/fpu'.

   There are a few directories at the top level of the `sysdeps'
hierarchy that are not for particular machine architectures.

`generic'
     As described above (*note Porting::), this is the subdirectory
     that every configuration implicitly uses after all others.

`ieee754'
     This directory is for code using the IEEE 754 floating-point
     format, where the C type `float' is IEEE 754 single-precision
     format, and `double' is IEEE 754 double-precision format.  Usually
     this directory is referred to in the `Implies' file in a machine
     architecture-specific directory, such as `m68k/Implies'.

`libm-ieee754'
     This directory contains an implementation of a mathematical library
     usable on platforms which use IEEE 754 conformant floating-point
     arithmetic.

`libm-i387'
     This is a special case.  Ideally the code should be in
     `sysdeps/i386/fpu' but for various reasons it is kept aside.

`posix'
     This directory contains implementations of things in the library in
     terms of POSIX.1 functions.  This includes some of the POSIX.1
     functions themselves.  Of course, POSIX.1 cannot be completely
     implemented in terms of itself, so a configuration using just
     `posix' cannot be complete.

`unix'
     This is the directory for Unix-like things.  *Note Porting to
     Unix::.  `unix' implies `posix'.  There are some special-purpose
     subdirectories of `unix':

    `unix/common'
          This directory is for things common to both BSD and System V
          release 4.  Both `unix/bsd' and `unix/sysv/sysv4' imply
          `unix/common'.

    `unix/inet'
          This directory is for `socket' and related functions on Unix
          systems.  `unix/inet/Subdirs' enables the `inet' top-level
          subdirectory.  `unix/common' implies `unix/inet'.

`mach'
     This is the directory for things based on the Mach microkernel
     from CMU (including the GNU operating system).  Other basic
     operating systems (VMS, for example) would have their own
     directories at the top level of the `sysdeps' hierarchy, parallel
     to `unix' and `mach'.

Porting the GNU C Library to Unix Systems
-----------------------------------------

   Most Unix systems are fundamentally very similar.  There are
variations between different machines, and variations in what
facilities are provided by the kernel.  But the interface to the
operating system facilities is, for the most part, pretty uniform and
simple.

   The code for Unix systems is in the directory `unix', at the top
level of the `sysdeps' hierarchy.  This directory contains
subdirectories (and subdirectory trees) for various Unix variants.

   The functions which are system calls in most Unix systems are
implemented in assembly code, which is generated automatically from
specifications in files named `syscalls.list'.  There are several such
files, one in `sysdeps/unix' and others in its subdirectories.  Some
special system calls are implemented in files that are named with a
suffix of `.S'; for example, `_exit.S'.  Files ending in `.S' are run
through the C preprocessor before being fed to the assembler.

   These files all use a set of macros that should be defined in
`sysdep.h'.  The `sysdep.h' file in `sysdeps/unix' partially defines
them; a `sysdep.h' file in another directory must finish defining them
for the particular machine and operating system variant.  See
`sysdeps/unix/sysdep.h' and the machine-specific `sysdep.h'
implementations to see what these macros are and what they should do.

   The system-specific makefile for the `unix' directory
(`sysdeps/unix/Makefile') gives rules to generate several files from
the Unix system you are building the library on (which is assumed to be
the target system you are building the library _for_).  All the
generated files are put in the directory where the object files are
kept; they should not affect the source tree itself.  The files
generated are `ioctls.h', `errnos.h', `sys/param.h', and `errlist.c'
(for the `stdio' section of the library).
