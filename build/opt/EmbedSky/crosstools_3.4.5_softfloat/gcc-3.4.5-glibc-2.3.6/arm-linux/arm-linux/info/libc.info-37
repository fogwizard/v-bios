Setting an Alarm
================

   The `alarm' and `setitimer' functions provide a mechanism for a
process to interrupt itself in the future.  They do this by setting a
timer; when the timer expires, the process receives a signal.

   Each process has three independent interval timers available:

   * A real-time timer that counts elapsed time.  This timer sends a
     `SIGALRM' signal to the process when it expires.

   * A virtual timer that counts processor time used by the process.
     This timer sends a `SIGVTALRM' signal to the process when it
     expires.

   * A profiling timer that counts both processor time used by the
     process, and processor time spent in system calls on behalf of the
     process.  This timer sends a `SIGPROF' signal to the process when
     it expires.

     This timer is useful for profiling in interpreters.  The interval
     timer mechanism does not have the fine granularity necessary for
     profiling native code.

   You can only have one timer of each kind set at any given time.  If
you set a timer that has not yet expired, that timer is simply reset to
the new value.

   You should establish a handler for the appropriate alarm signal using
`signal' or `sigaction' before issuing a call to `setitimer' or
`alarm'.  Otherwise, an unusual chain of events could cause the timer
to expire before your program establishes the handler.  In this case it
would be terminated, since termination is the default action for the
alarm signals.  *Note Signal Handling::.

   To be able to use the alarm function to interrupt a system call which
might block otherwise indefinitely it is important to _not_ set the
`SA_RESTART' flag when registering the signal handler using
`sigaction'.  When not using `sigaction' things get even uglier: the
`signal' function has to fixed semantics with respect to restarts.  The
BSD semantics for this function is to set the flag.  Therefore, if
`sigaction' for whatever reason cannot be used, it is necessary to use
`sysv_signal' and not `signal'.

   The `setitimer' function is the primary means for setting an alarm.
This facility is declared in the header file `sys/time.h'.  The `alarm'
function, declared in `unistd.h', provides a somewhat simpler interface
for setting the real-time timer.

 - Data Type: struct itimerval
     This structure is used to specify when a timer should expire.  It
     contains the following members:
    `struct timeval it_interval'
          This is the period between successive timer interrupts.  If
          zero, the alarm will only be sent once.

    `struct timeval it_value'
          This is the period between now and the first timer interrupt.
          If zero, the alarm is disabled.

     The `struct timeval' data type is described in *Note Elapsed
     Time::.

 - Function: int setitimer (int WHICH, struct itimerval *NEW, struct
          itimerval *OLD)
     The `setitimer' function sets the timer specified by WHICH
     according to NEW.  The WHICH argument can have a value of
     `ITIMER_REAL', `ITIMER_VIRTUAL', or `ITIMER_PROF'.

     If OLD is not a null pointer, `setitimer' returns information
     about any previous unexpired timer of the same kind in the
     structure it points to.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EINVAL'
          The timer period is too large.

 - Function: int getitimer (int WHICH, struct itimerval *OLD)
     The `getitimer' function stores information about the timer
     specified by WHICH in the structure pointed at by OLD.

     The return value and error conditions are the same as for
     `setitimer'.

`ITIMER_REAL'
     This constant can be used as the WHICH argument to the `setitimer'
     and `getitimer' functions to specify the real-time timer.

`ITIMER_VIRTUAL'
     This constant can be used as the WHICH argument to the `setitimer'
     and `getitimer' functions to specify the virtual timer.

`ITIMER_PROF'
     This constant can be used as the WHICH argument to the `setitimer'
     and `getitimer' functions to specify the profiling timer.

 - Function: unsigned int alarm (unsigned int SECONDS)
     The `alarm' function sets the real-time timer to expire in SECONDS
     seconds.  If you want to cancel any existing alarm, you can do
     this by calling `alarm' with a SECONDS argument of zero.

     The return value indicates how many seconds remain before the
     previous alarm would have been sent.  If there is no previous
     alarm, `alarm' returns zero.

   The `alarm' function could be defined in terms of `setitimer' like
this:

     unsigned int
     alarm (unsigned int seconds)
     {
       struct itimerval old, new;
       new.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;
       new.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;
       new.it_value.tv_usec = 0;
       new.it_value.tv_sec = (long int) seconds;
       if (setitimer (ITIMER_REAL, &new, &old) < 0)
         return 0;
       else
         return old.it_value.tv_sec;
     }

   There is an example showing the use of the `alarm' function in *Note
Handler Returns::.

   If you simply want your process to wait for a given number of
seconds, you should use the `sleep' function.  *Note Sleeping::.

   You shouldn't count on the signal arriving precisely when the timer
expires.  In a multiprocessing environment there is typically some
amount of delay involved.

   *Portability Note:* The `setitimer' and `getitimer' functions are
derived from BSD Unix, while the `alarm' function is specified by the
POSIX.1 standard.  `setitimer' is more powerful than `alarm', but
`alarm' is more widely used.

Sleeping
========

   The function `sleep' gives a simple way to make the program wait for
a short interval.  If your program doesn't use signals (except to
terminate), then you can expect `sleep' to wait reliably throughout the
specified interval.  Otherwise, `sleep' can return sooner if a signal
arrives; if you want to wait for a given interval regardless of
signals, use `select' (*note Waiting for I/O::) and don't specify any
descriptors to wait for.

 - Function: unsigned int sleep (unsigned int SECONDS)
     The `sleep' function waits for SECONDS or until a signal is
     delivered, whichever happens first.

     If `sleep' function returns because the requested interval is over,
     it returns a value of zero.  If it returns because of delivery of a
     signal, its return value is the remaining time in the sleep
     interval.

     The `sleep' function is declared in `unistd.h'.

   Resist the temptation to implement a sleep for a fixed amount of
time by using the return value of `sleep', when nonzero, to call
`sleep' again.  This will work with a certain amount of accuracy as
long as signals arrive infrequently.  But each signal can cause the
eventual wakeup time to be off by an additional second or so.  Suppose a
few signals happen to arrive in rapid succession by bad luck--there is
no limit on how much this could shorten or lengthen the wait.

   Instead, compute the calendar time at which the program should stop
waiting, and keep trying to wait until that calendar time.  This won't
be off by more than a second.  With just a little more work, you can use
`select' and make the waiting period quite accurate.  (Of course, heavy
system load can cause additional unavoidable delays--unless the machine
is dedicated to one application, there is no way you can avoid this.)

   On some systems, `sleep' can do strange things if your program uses
`SIGALRM' explicitly.  Even if `SIGALRM' signals are being ignored or
blocked when `sleep' is called, `sleep' might return prematurely on
delivery of a `SIGALRM' signal.  If you have established a handler for
`SIGALRM' signals and a `SIGALRM' signal is delivered while the process
is sleeping, the action taken might be just to cause `sleep' to return
instead of invoking your handler.  And, if `sleep' is interrupted by
delivery of a signal whose handler requests an alarm or alters the
handling of `SIGALRM', this handler and `sleep' will interfere.

   On the GNU system, it is safe to use `sleep' and `SIGALRM' in the
same program, because `sleep' does not work by means of `SIGALRM'.

 - Function: int nanosleep (const struct timespec *REQUESTED_TIME,
          struct timespec *REMAINING)
     If resolution to seconds is not enough the `nanosleep' function can
     be used.  As the name suggests the sleep interval can be specified
     in nanoseconds.  The actual elapsed time of the sleep interval
     might be longer since the system rounds the elapsed time you
     request up to the next integer multiple of the actual resolution
     the system can deliver.

     *`requested_time' is the elapsed time of the interval you want to
     sleep.

     The function returns as *`remaining' the elapsed time left in the
     interval for which you requested to sleep.  If the interval
     completed without getting interrupted by a signal, this is zero.

     `struct timespec' is described in *Note Elapsed Time::.

     If the function returns because the interval is over the return
     value is zero.  If the function returns -1 the global variable
     ERRNO is set to the following values:

    `EINTR'
          The call was interrupted because a signal was delivered to
          the thread.  If the REMAINING parameter is not the null
          pointer the structure pointed to by REMAINING is updated to
          contain the remaining elapsed time.

    `EINVAL'
          The nanosecond value in the REQUESTED_TIME parameter contains
          an illegal value.  Either the value is negative or greater
          than or equal to 1000 million.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     `nanosleep' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these
     resources stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this
     calls to `nanosleep' should be protected using cancellation
     handlers.

     The `nanosleep' function is declared in `time.h'.

Resource Usage
==============

   The function `getrusage' and the data type `struct rusage' are used
to examine the resource usage of a process.  They are declared in
`sys/resource.h'.

 - Function: int getrusage (int PROCESSES, struct rusage *RUSAGE)
     This function reports resource usage totals for processes
     specified by PROCESSES, storing the information in `*RUSAGE'.

     In most systems, PROCESSES has only two valid values:

    `RUSAGE_SELF'
          Just the current process.

    `RUSAGE_CHILDREN'
          All child processes (direct and indirect) that have already
          terminated.

     In the GNU system, you can also inquire about a particular child
     process by specifying its process ID.

     The return value of `getrusage' is zero for success, and `-1' for
     failure.

    `EINVAL'
          The argument PROCESSES is not valid.

   One way of getting resource usage for a particular child process is
with the function `wait4', which returns totals for a child when it
terminates.  *Note BSD Wait Functions::.

 - Data Type: struct rusage
     This data type stores various resource usage statistics.  It has
     the following members, and possibly others:

    `struct timeval ru_utime'
          Time spent executing user instructions.

    `struct timeval ru_stime'
          Time spent in operating system code on behalf of PROCESSES.

    `long int ru_maxrss'
          The maximum resident set size used, in kilobytes.  That is,
          the maximum number of kilobytes of physical memory that
          PROCESSES used simultaneously.

    `long int ru_ixrss'
          An integral value expressed in kilobytes times ticks of
          execution, which indicates the amount of memory used by text
          that was shared with other processes.

    `long int ru_idrss'
          An integral value expressed the same way, which is the amount
          of unshared memory used for data.

    `long int ru_isrss'
          An integral value expressed the same way, which is the amount
          of unshared memory used for stack space.

    `long int ru_minflt'
          The number of page faults which were serviced without
          requiring any I/O.

    `long int ru_majflt'
          The number of page faults which were serviced by doing I/O.

    `long int ru_nswap'
          The number of times PROCESSES was swapped entirely out of
          main memory.

    `long int ru_inblock'
          The number of times the file system had to read from the disk
          on behalf of PROCESSES.

    `long int ru_oublock'
          The number of times the file system had to write to the disk
          on behalf of PROCESSES.

    `long int ru_msgsnd'
          Number of IPC messages sent.

    `long int ru_msgrcv'
          Number of IPC messages received.

    `long int ru_nsignals'
          Number of signals received.

    `long int ru_nvcsw'
          The number of times PROCESSES voluntarily invoked a context
          switch (usually to wait for some service).

    `long int ru_nivcsw'
          The number of times an involuntary context switch took place
          (because a time slice expired, or another process of higher
          priority was scheduled).

   `vtimes' is a historical function that does some of what `getrusage'
does.  `getrusage' is a better choice.

   `vtimes' and its `vtimes' data structure are declared in
`sys/vtimes.h'.

 - Function: int vtimes (struct vtimes CURRENT, struct vtimes CHILD)
     `vtimes' reports resource usage totals for a process.

     If CURRENT is non-null, `vtimes' stores resource usage totals for
     the invoking process alone in the structure to which it points.  If
     CHILD is non-null, `vtimes' stores resource usage totals for all
     past children (which have terminated) of the invoking process in
     the structure to which it points.

      - Data Type: struct vtimes
          This data type contains information about the resource usage
          of a process.  Each member corresponds to a member of the
          `struct rusage' data type described above.

         `vm_utime'
               User CPU time.  Analogous to `ru_utime' in `struct
               rusage'

         `vm_stime'
               System CPU time.  Analogous to `ru_stime' in `struct
               rusage'

         `vm_idsrss'
               Data and stack memory.  The sum of the values that would
               be reported as `ru_idrss' and `ru_isrss' in `struct
               rusage'

         `vm_ixrss'
               Shared memory.  Analogous to `ru_ixrss' in `struct
               rusage'

         `vm_maxrss'
               Maximent resident set size.  Analogous to `ru_maxrss' in
               `struct rusage'

         `vm_majflt'
               Major page faults.  Analogous to `ru_majflt' in `struct
               rusage'

         `vm_minflt'
               Minor page faults.  Analogous to `ru_minflt' in `struct
               rusage'

         `vm_nswap'
               Swap count.  Analogous to `ru_nswap' in `struct rusage'

         `vm_inblk'
               Disk reads.  Analogous to `ru_inblk' in `struct rusage'

         `vm_oublk'
               Disk writes.  Analogous to `ru_oublk' in `struct rusage'

     The return value is zero if the function succeeds; `-1' otherwise.

   An additional historical function for examining resource usage,
`vtimes', is supported but not documented here.  It is declared in
`sys/vtimes.h'.


File: libc.info,  Node: Limits on Resources,  Next: Priority,  Prev: Resource Usage,  Up: Resource Usage And Limitation

Limiting Resource Usage
=======================

   You can specify limits for the resource usage of a process.  When the
process tries to exceed a limit, it may get a signal, or the system call
by which it tried to do so may fail, depending on the resource.  Each
process initially inherits its limit values from its parent, but it can
subsequently change them.

   There are two per-process limits associated with a resource:

"current limit"
     The current limit is the value the system will not allow usage to
     exceed.  It is also called the "soft limit" because the process
     being limited can generally raise the current limit at will.

"maximum limit"
     The maximum limit is the maximum value to which a process is
     allowed to set its current limit.  It is also called the "hard
     limit" because there is no way for a process to get around it.  A
     process may lower its own maximum limit, but only the superuser
     may increase a maximum limit.

   The symbols for use with `getrlimit', `setrlimit', `getrlimit64',
and `setrlimit64' are defined in `sys/resource.h'.

 - Function: int getrlimit (int RESOURCE, struct rlimit *RLP)
     Read the current and maximum limits for the resource RESOURCE and
     store them in `*RLP'.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The only
     possible `errno' error condition is `EFAULT'.

     When the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact `getrlimit64'.  Thus, the
     LFS interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: int getrlimit64 (int RESOURCE, struct rlimit64 *RLP)
     This function is similar to `getrlimit' but its second parameter is
     a pointer to a variable of type `struct rlimit64', which allows it
     to read values which wouldn't fit in the member of a `struct
     rlimit'.

     If the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit machine, this function is available under the name
     `getrlimit' and so transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: int setrlimit (int RESOURCE, const struct rlimit *RLP)
     Store the current and maximum limits for the resource RESOURCE in
     `*RLP'.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The
     following `errno' error condition is possible:

    `EPERM'
             * The process tried to raise a current limit beyond the
               maximum limit.

             * The process tried to raise a maximum limit, but is not
               superuser.

     When the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact `setrlimit64'.  Thus, the
     LFS interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: int setrlimit64 (int RESOURCE, const struct rlimit64 *RLP)
     This function is similar to `setrlimit' but its second parameter is
     a pointer to a variable of type `struct rlimit64' which allows it
     to set values which wouldn't fit in the member of a `struct
     rlimit'.

     If the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit machine this function is available under the name
     `setrlimit' and so transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Data Type: struct rlimit
     This structure is used with `getrlimit' to receive limit values,
     and with `setrlimit' to specify limit values for a particular
     process and resource.  It has two fields:

    `rlim_t rlim_cur'
          The current limit

    `rlim_t rlim_max'
          The maximum limit.

     For `getrlimit', the structure is an output; it receives the
     current values.  For `setrlimit', it specifies the new values.

   For the LFS functions a similar type is defined in `sys/resource.h'.

 - Data Type: struct rlimit64
     This structure is analogous to the `rlimit' structure above, but
     its components have wider ranges.  It has two fields:

    `rlim64_t rlim_cur'
          This is analogous to `rlimit.rlim_cur', but with a different
          type.

    `rlim64_t rlim_max'
          This is analogous to `rlimit.rlim_max', but with a different
          type.


   Here is a list of resources for which you can specify a limit.
Memory and file sizes are measured in bytes.

`RLIMIT_CPU'
     The maximum amount of CPU time the process can use.  If it runs for
     longer than this, it gets a signal: `SIGXCPU'.  The value is
     measured in seconds.  *Note Operation Error Signals::.

`RLIMIT_FSIZE'
     The maximum size of file the process can create.  Trying to write a
     larger file causes a signal: `SIGXFSZ'.  *Note Operation Error
     Signals::.

`RLIMIT_DATA'
     The maximum size of data memory for the process.  If the process
     tries to allocate data memory beyond this amount, the allocation
     function fails.

`RLIMIT_STACK'
     The maximum stack size for the process.  If the process tries to
     extend its stack past this size, it gets a `SIGSEGV' signal.
     *Note Program Error Signals::.

`RLIMIT_CORE'
     The maximum size core file that this process can create.  If the
     process terminates and would dump a core file larger than this,
     then no core file is created.  So setting this limit to zero
     prevents core files from ever being created.

`RLIMIT_RSS'
     The maximum amount of physical memory that this process should get.
     This parameter is a guide for the system's scheduler and memory
     allocator; the system may give the process more memory when there
     is a surplus.

`RLIMIT_MEMLOCK'
     The maximum amount of memory that can be locked into physical
     memory (so it will never be paged out).

`RLIMIT_NPROC'
     The maximum number of processes that can be created with the same
     user ID.  If you have reached the limit for your user ID, `fork'
     will fail with `EAGAIN'.  *Note Creating a Process::.

`RLIMIT_NOFILE'
`RLIMIT_OFILE'
     The maximum number of files that the process can open.  If it
     tries to open more files than this, its open attempt fails with
     `errno' `EMFILE'.  *Note Error Codes::.  Not all systems support
     this limit; GNU does, and 4.4 BSD does.

`RLIMIT_AS'
     The maximum size of total memory that this process should get.  If
     the process tries to allocate more memory beyond this amount with,
     for example, `brk', `malloc', `mmap' or `sbrk', the allocation
     function fails.

`RLIM_NLIMITS'
     The number of different resource limits.  Any valid RESOURCE
     operand must be less than `RLIM_NLIMITS'.

 - Constant: int RLIM_INFINITY
     This constant stands for a value of "infinity" when supplied as
     the limit value in `setrlimit'.

   The following are historical functions to do some of what the
functions above do.  The functions above are better choices.

   `ulimit' and the command symbols are declared in `ulimit.h'.

 - Function: int ulimit (int CMD, ...)
     `ulimit' gets the current limit or sets the current and maximum
     limit for a particular resource for the calling process according
     to the command CMD.a

     If you are getting a limit, the command argument is the only
     argument.  If you are setting a limit, there is a second argument:
     `long int' LIMIT which is the value to which you are setting the
     limit.

     The CMD values and the operations they specify are:
    `GETFSIZE'
          Get the current limit on the size of a file, in units of 512
          bytes.

    `SETFSIZE'
          Set the current and maximum limit on the size of a file to
          LIMIT * 512 bytes.

     There are also some other CMD values that may do things on some
     systems, but they are not supported.

     Only the superuser may increase a maximum limit.

     When you successfully get a limit, the return value of `ulimit' is
     that limit, which is never negative.  When you successfully set a
     limit, the return value is zero.  When the function fails, the
     return value is `-1' and `errno' is set according to the reason:

    `EPERM'
          A process tried to increase a maximum limit, but is not
          superuser.


   `vlimit' and its resource symbols are declared in `sys/vlimit.h'.

 - Function: int vlimit (int RESOURCE, int LIMIT)
     `vlimit' sets the current limit for a resource for a process.

     RESOURCE identifies the resource:

    `LIM_CPU'
          Maximum CPU time.  Same as `RLIMIT_CPU' for `setrlimit'.

    `LIM_FSIZE'
          Maximum file size.  Same as `RLIMIT_FSIZE' for `setrlimit'.

    `LIM_DATA'
          Maximum data memory.  Same as `RLIMIT_DATA' for `setrlimit'.

    `LIM_STACK'
          Maximum stack size.  Same as `RLIMIT_STACK' for `setrlimit'.

    `LIM_CORE'
          Maximum core file size.  Same as `RLIMIT_COR' for `setrlimit'.

    `LIM_MAXRSS'
          Maximum physical memory.  Same as `RLIMIT_RSS' for
          `setrlimit'.

     The return value is zero for success, and `-1' with `errno' set
     accordingly for failure:

    `EPERM'
          The process tried to set its current limit beyond its maximum
          limit.

Process CPU Priority And Scheduling
===================================

   When multiple processes simultaneously require CPU time, the system's
scheduling policy and process CPU priorities determine which processes
get it.  This section describes how that determination is made and GNU
C library functions to control it.

   It is common to refer to CPU scheduling simply as scheduling and a
process' CPU priority simply as the process' priority, with the CPU
resource being implied.  Bear in mind, though, that CPU time is not the
only resource a process uses or that processes contend for.  In some
cases, it is not even particularly important.  Giving a process a high
"priority" may have very little effect on how fast a process runs with
respect to other processes.  The priorities discussed in this section
apply only to CPU time.

   CPU scheduling is a complex issue and different systems do it in
wildly different ways.  New ideas continually develop and find their
way into the intricacies of the various systems' scheduling algorithms.
This section discusses the general concepts, some specifics of systems
that commonly use the GNU C library, and some standards.

   For simplicity, we talk about CPU contention as if there is only one
CPU in the system.  But all the same principles apply when a processor
has multiple CPUs, and knowing that the number of processes that can
run at any one time is equal to the number of CPUs, you can easily
extrapolate the information.

   The functions described in this section are all defined by the
POSIX.1 and POSIX.1b standards (the `sched...' functions are POSIX.1b).
However, POSIX does not define any semantics for the values that these
functions get and set.  In this chapter, the semantics are based on the
Linux kernel's implementation of the POSIX standard.  As you will see,
the Linux implementation is quite the inverse of what the authors of the
POSIX syntax had in mind.

Absolute Priority
-----------------

   Every process has an absolute priority, and it is represented by a
number.  The higher the number, the higher the absolute priority.

   On systems of the past, and most systems today, all processes have
absolute priority 0 and this section is irrelevant.  In that case,
*Note Traditional Scheduling::.  Absolute priorities were invented to
accommodate realtime systems, in which it is vital that certain
processes be able to respond to external events happening in real time,
which means they cannot wait around while some other process that _wants
to_, but doesn't _need to_ run occupies the CPU.

   When two processes are in contention to use the CPU at any instant,
the one with the higher absolute priority always gets it.  This is true
even if the process with the lower priority is already using the CPU
(i.e. the scheduling is preemptive).  Of course, we're only talking
about processes that are running or "ready to run," which means they are
ready to execute instructions right now.  When a process blocks to wait
for something like I/O, its absolute priority is irrelevant.

   *Note:*  The term "runnable" is a synonym for "ready to run."

   When two processes are running or ready to run and both have the same
absolute priority, it's more interesting.  In that case, who gets the
CPU is determined by the scheduling policy.  If the processes have
absolute priority 0, the traditional scheduling policy described in
*Note Traditional Scheduling:: applies.  Otherwise, the policies
described in *Note Realtime Scheduling:: apply.

   You normally give an absolute priority above 0 only to a process that
can be trusted not to hog the CPU.  Such processes are designed to block
(or terminate) after relatively short CPU runs.

   A process begins life with the same absolute priority as its parent
process.  Functions described in *Note Basic Scheduling Functions:: can
change it.

   Only a privileged process can change a process' absolute priority to
something other than `0'.  Only a privileged process or the target
process' owner can change its absolute priority at all.

   POSIX requires absolute priority values used with the realtime
scheduling policies to be consecutive with a range of at least 32.  On
Linux, they are 1 through 99.  The functions `sched_get_priority_max'
and `sched_set_priority_min' portably tell you what the range is on a
particular system.

Using Absolute Priority
.......................

   One thing you must keep in mind when designing real time
applications is that having higher absolute priority than any other
process doesn't guarantee the process can run continuously.  Two things
that can wreck a good CPU run are interrupts and page faults.

   Interrupt handlers live in that limbo between processes.  The CPU is
executing instructions, but they aren't part of any process.  An
interrupt will stop even the highest priority process.  So you must
allow for slight delays and make sure that no device in the system has
an interrupt handler that could cause too long a delay between
instructions for your process.

   Similarly, a page fault causes what looks like a straightforward
sequence of instructions to take a long time.  The fact that other
processes get to run while the page faults in is of no consequence,
because as soon as the I/O is complete, the high priority process will
kick them out and run again, but the wait for the I/O itself could be a
problem.  To neutralize this threat, use `mlock' or `mlockall'.

   There are a few ramifications of the absoluteness of this priority
on a single-CPU system that you need to keep in mind when you choose to
set a priority and also when you're working on a program that runs with
high absolute priority.  Consider a process that has higher absolute
priority than any other process in the system and due to a bug in its
program, it gets into an infinite loop.  It will never cede the CPU.
You can't run a command to kill it because your command would need to
get the CPU in order to run.  The errant program is in complete
control.  It controls the vertical, it controls the horizontal.

   There are two ways to avoid this: 1) keep a shell running somewhere
with a higher absolute priority.  2) keep a controlling terminal
attached to the high priority process group.  All the priority in the
world won't stop an interrupt handler from running and delivering a
signal to the process if you hit Control-C.

   Some systems use absolute priority as a means of allocating a fixed
percentage of CPU time to a process.  To do this, a super high priority
privileged process constantly monitors the process' CPU usage and raises
its absolute priority when the process isn't getting its entitled share
and lowers it when the process is exceeding it.

   *Note:*  The absolute priority is sometimes called the "static
priority."  We don't use that term in this manual because it misses the
most important feature of the absolute priority:  its absoluteness.

Realtime Scheduling
-------------------

   Whenever two processes with the same absolute priority are ready to
run, the kernel has a decision to make, because only one can run at a
time.  If the processes have absolute priority 0, the kernel makes this
decision as described in *Note Traditional Scheduling::.  Otherwise,
the decision is as described in this section.

   If two processes are ready to run but have different absolute
priorities, the decision is much simpler, and is described in *Note
Absolute Priority::.

   Each process has a scheduling policy.  For processes with absolute
priority other than zero, there are two available:

  1. First Come First Served

  2. Round Robin

   The most sensible case is where all the processes with a certain
absolute priority have the same scheduling policy.  We'll discuss that
first.

   In Round Robin, processes share the CPU, each one running for a small
quantum of time ("time slice") and then yielding to another in a
circular fashion.  Of course, only processes that are ready to run and
have the same absolute priority are in this circle.

   In First Come First Served, the process that has been waiting the
longest to run gets the CPU, and it keeps it until it voluntarily
relinquishes the CPU, runs out of things to do (blocks), or gets
preempted by a higher priority process.

   First Come First Served, along with maximal absolute priority and
careful control of interrupts and page faults, is the one to use when a
process absolutely, positively has to run at full CPU speed or not at
all.

   Judicious use of `sched_yield' function invocations by processes
with First Come First Served scheduling policy forms a good compromise
between Round Robin and First Come First Served.

   To understand how scheduling works when processes of different
scheduling policies occupy the same absolute priority, you have to know
the nitty gritty details of how processes enter and exit the ready to
run list:

   In both cases, the ready to run list is organized as a true queue,
where a process gets pushed onto the tail when it becomes ready to run
and is popped off the head when the scheduler decides to run it.  Note
that ready to run and running are two mutually exclusive states.  When
the scheduler runs a process, that process is no longer ready to run
and no longer in the ready to run list.  When the process stops
running, it may go back to being ready to run again.

   The only difference between a process that is assigned the Round
Robin scheduling policy and a process that is assigned First Come First
Serve is that in the former case, the process is automatically booted
off the CPU after a certain amount of time.  When that happens, the
process goes back to being ready to run, which means it enters the
queue at the tail.  The time quantum we're talking about is small.
Really small.  This is not your father's timesharing.  For example,
with the Linux kernel, the round robin time slice is a thousand times
shorter than its typical time slice for traditional scheduling.

   A process begins life with the same scheduling policy as its parent
process.  Functions described in *Note Basic Scheduling Functions:: can
change it.

   Only a privileged process can set the scheduling policy of a process
that has absolute priority higher than 0.

Basic Scheduling Functions
--------------------------

   This section describes functions in the GNU C library for setting the
absolute priority and scheduling policy of a process.

   *Portability Note:*  On systems that have the functions in this
section, the macro _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING is defined in
`<unistd.h>'.

   For the case that the scheduling policy is traditional scheduling,
more functions to fine tune the scheduling are in *Note Traditional
Scheduling::.

   Don't try to make too much out of the naming and structure of these
functions.  They don't match the concepts described in this manual
because the functions are as defined by POSIX.1b, but the implementation
on systems that use the GNU C library is the inverse of what the POSIX
structure contemplates.  The POSIX scheme assumes that the primary
scheduling parameter is the scheduling policy and that the priority
value, if any, is a parameter of the scheduling policy.  In the
implementation, though, the priority value is king and the scheduling
policy, if anything, only fine tunes the effect of that priority.

   The symbols in this section are declared by including file `sched.h'.

 - Data Type: struct sched_param
     This structure describes an absolute priority.
    `int sched_priority'
          absolute priority value

 - Function: int sched_setscheduler (pid_t PID, int POLICY, const
          struct sched_param *PARAM)
     This function sets both the absolute priority and the scheduling
     policy for a process.

     It assigns the absolute priority value given by PARAM and the
     scheduling policy POLICY to the process with Process ID PID, or
     the calling process if PID is zero.  If POLICY is negative,
     `sched_setscheduler' keeps the existing scheduling policy.

     The following macros represent the valid values for POLICY:

    `SCHED_OTHER'
          Traditional Scheduling

    `SCHED_FIFO'
          First In First Out

    `SCHED_RR'
          Round Robin

     On success, the return value is `0'.  Otherwise, it is `-1' and
     `ERRNO' is set accordingly.  The `errno' values specific to this
     function are:

    `EPERM'
             * The calling process does not have `CAP_SYS_NICE'
               permission and POLICY is not `SCHED_OTHER' (or it's
               negative and the existing policy is not `SCHED_OTHER'.

             * The calling process does not have `CAP_SYS_NICE'
               permission and its owner is not the target process'
               owner.  I.e.  the effective uid of the calling process
               is neither the effective nor the real uid of process PID.

    `ESRCH'
          There is no process with pid PID and PID is not zero.

    `EINVAL'
             * POLICY does not identify an existing scheduling policy.

             * The absolute priority value identified by *PARAM is
               outside the valid range for the scheduling policy POLICY
               (or the existing scheduling policy if POLICY is
               negative) or PARAM is null.  `sched_get_priority_max'
               and `sched_get_priority_min' tell you what the valid
               range is.

             * PID is negative.


 - Function: int sched_getscheduler (pid_t PID)
     This function returns the scheduling policy assigned to the
     process with Process ID (pid) PID, or the calling process if PID
     is zero.

     The return value is the scheduling policy.  See
     `sched_setscheduler' for the possible values.

     If the function fails, the return value is instead `-1' and
     `errno' is set accordingly.

     The `errno' values specific to this function are:

    `ESRCH'
          There is no process with pid PID and it is not zero.

    `EINVAL'
          PID is negative.

     Note that this function is not an exact mate to
     `sched_setscheduler' because while that function sets the
     scheduling policy and the absolute priority, this function gets
     only the scheduling policy.  To get the absolute priority, use
     `sched_getparam'.


 - Function: int sched_setparam (pid_t PID, const struct sched_param
          *PARAM)
     This function sets a process' absolute priority.

     It is functionally identical to `sched_setscheduler' with POLICY =
     `-1'.


 - Function: int sched_getparam (pid_t PID, const struct sched_param
          *PARAM)
     This function returns a process' absolute priority.

     PID is the Process ID (pid) of the process whose absolute priority
     you want to know.

     PARAM is a pointer to a structure in which the function stores the
     absolute priority of the process.

     On success, the return value is `0'.  Otherwise, it is `-1' and
     `ERRNO' is set accordingly.  The `errno' values specific to this
     function are:

    `ESRCH'
          There is no process with pid PID and it is not zero.

    `EINVAL'
          PID is negative.


 - Function: int sched_get_priority_min (int *POLICY);
     This function returns the lowest absolute priority value that is
     allowable for a process with scheduling policy POLICY.

     On Linux, it is 0 for SCHED_OTHER and 1 for everything else.

     On success, the return value is `0'.  Otherwise, it is `-1' and
     `ERRNO' is set accordingly.  The `errno' values specific to this
     function are:

    `EINVAL'
          POLICY does not identify an existing scheduling policy.


 - Function: int sched_get_priority_max (int *POLICY);
     This function returns the highest absolute priority value that is
     allowable for a process that with scheduling policy POLICY.

     On Linux, it is 0 for SCHED_OTHER and 99 for everything else.

     On success, the return value is `0'.  Otherwise, it is `-1' and
     `ERRNO' is set accordingly.  The `errno' values specific to this
     function are:

    `EINVAL'
          POLICY does not identify an existing scheduling policy.


 - Function: int sched_rr_get_interval (pid_t PID, struct timespec
          *INTERVAL)
     This function returns the length of the quantum (time slice) used
     with the Round Robin scheduling policy, if it is used, for the
     process with Process ID PID.

     It returns the length of time as INTERVAL.

     With a Linux kernel, the round robin time slice is always 150
     microseconds, and PID need not even be a real pid.

     The return value is `0' on success and in the pathological case
     that it fails, the return value is `-1' and `errno' is set
     accordingly.  There is nothing specific that can go wrong with this
     function, so there are no specific `errno' values.


 - Function: int sched_yield (void)
     This function voluntarily gives up the process' claim on the CPU.

     Technically, `sched_yield' causes the calling process to be made
     immediately ready to run (as opposed to running, which is what it
     was before).  This means that if it has absolute priority higher
     than 0, it gets pushed onto the tail of the queue of processes
     that share its absolute priority and are ready to run, and it will
     run again when its turn next arrives.  If its absolute priority is
     0, it is more complicated, but still has the effect of yielding
     the CPU to other processes.

     If there are no other processes that share the calling process'
     absolute priority, this function doesn't have any effect.

     To the extent that the containing program is oblivious to what
     other processes in the system are doing and how fast it executes,
     this function appears as a no-op.

     The return value is `0' on success and in the pathological case
     that it fails, the return value is `-1' and `errno' is set
     accordingly.  There is nothing specific that can go wrong with this
     function, so there are no specific `errno' values.

Traditional Scheduling
----------------------

   This section is about the scheduling among processes whose absolute
priority is 0.  When the system hands out the scraps of CPU time that
are left over after the processes with higher absolute priority have
taken all they want, the scheduling described herein determines who
among the great unwashed processes gets them.

Introduction To Traditional Scheduling
......................................

   Long before there was absolute priority (See *Note Absolute
Priority::), Unix systems were scheduling the CPU using this system.
When Posix came in like the Romans and imposed absolute priorities to
accommodate the needs of realtime processing, it left the indigenous
Absolute Priority Zero processes to govern themselves by their own
familiar scheduling policy.

   Indeed, absolute priorities higher than zero are not available on
many systems today and are not typically used when they are, being
intended mainly for computers that do realtime processing.  So this
section describes the only scheduling many programmers need to be
concerned about.

   But just to be clear about the scope of this scheduling: Any time a
process with a absolute priority of 0 and a process with an absolute
priority higher than 0 are ready to run at the same time, the one with
absolute priority 0 does not run.  If it's already running when the
higher priority ready-to-run process comes into existence, it stops
immediately.

   In addition to its absolute priority of zero, every process has
another priority, which we will refer to as "dynamic priority" because
it changes over time.  The dynamic priority is meaningless for
processes with an absolute priority higher than zero.

   The dynamic priority sometimes determines who gets the next turn on
the CPU.  Sometimes it determines how long turns last.  Sometimes it
determines whether a process can kick another off the CPU.

   In Linux, the value is a combination of these things, but mostly it
is just determines the length of the time slice.  The higher a process'
dynamic priority, the longer a shot it gets on the CPU when it gets one.
If it doesn't use up its time slice before giving up the CPU to do
something like wait for I/O, it is favored for getting the CPU back when
it's ready for it, to finish out its time slice.  Other than that,
selection of processes for new time slices is basically round robin.
But the scheduler does throw a bone to the low priority processes: A
process' dynamic priority rises every time it is snubbed in the
scheduling process.  In Linux, even the fat kid gets to play.

   The fluctuation of a process' dynamic priority is regulated by
another value: The "nice" value.  The nice value is an integer, usually
in the range -20 to 20, and represents an upper limit on a process'
dynamic priority.  The higher the nice number, the lower that limit.

   On a typical Linux system, for example, a process with a nice value
of 20 can get only 10 milliseconds on the CPU at a time, whereas a
process with a nice value of -20 can achieve a high enough priority to
get 400 milliseconds.

   The idea of the nice value is deferential courtesy.  In the
beginning, in the Unix garden of Eden, all processes shared equally in
the bounty of the computer system.  But not all processes really need
the same share of CPU time, so the nice value gave a courteous process
the ability to refuse its equal share of CPU time that others might
prosper.  Hence, the higher a process' nice value, the nicer the
process is.  (Then a snake came along and offered some process a
negative nice value and the system became the crass resource allocation
system we know today).

   Dynamic priorities tend upward and downward with an objective of
smoothing out allocation of CPU time and giving quick response time to
infrequent requests.  But they never exceed their nice limits, so on a
heavily loaded CPU, the nice value effectively determines how fast a
process runs.

   In keeping with the socialistic heritage of Unix process priority, a
process begins life with the same nice value as its parent process and
can raise it at will.  A process can also raise the nice value of any
other process owned by the same user (or effective user).  But only a
privileged process can lower its nice value.  A privileged process can
also raise or lower another process' nice value.

   GNU C Library functions for getting and setting nice values are
described in *Note Traditional Scheduling Functions::.
